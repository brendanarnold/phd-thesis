\label{Sec:Theo:Dft}

Density functional theory (DFT) is an ab-initio technique for calculating the electron density of a material. Coupled with the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, this means that the physical system at zero temperature can be completely determined from its ground state electron density.

DFT is an exact formulation of the ground state electron density,  Hamiltonian as follows,
