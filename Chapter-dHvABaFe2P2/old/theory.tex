\section{\dHvA Oscillations}

\dHvA oscillations occur in the measurement of several parameters which are dependant on the density of states at the Fermi surface of a material. As an increasing magnetic field is applied, fluctuations in a measurement are observed which are uniformly periodic with the inverse of the field --
