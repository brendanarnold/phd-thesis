\subsubsection{Basic \ac{LK} formula fitting}

A series of field sweeps were taken with $H$ at \unit[12]{\degree}, \unit[28]{\degree} and \unit[46]{\degree} from $[001]$ in the $[110]$ direction. These were performed at a variety of temperatures from base ($\approx\unit[0.3]{K}$) to above \unit[2]{K}. Corrections were applied as detailed in section\ref{Sec:Exp:TemperatureCorrection}. \Fig~\ref{Fig:ResD:SimpleLKFits} shows the Fourier amplitude of various peaks as a function of temperature along with fits to equation~\ref{Eqn:Exp:TempTermOscillationAmp}. The field range for the FFT was was necessarily large enough that individual peaks did not overlap and also could be observed across a reasonable range of temperatures but also small enough so that the $B$ dependent Dingle factor did not play too large a role and so an average $B$ field can be assumed. The results from these fits are shown in table \ref{Tab:ResD:EffectiveMassResults} along with the fit ranges. All FFTs in the plot were taken over an interval of \unit[12--18]{T} with the exception of the $\gamma_2$ fit which was taken between \unit[16-18]{T} so as to attain an appreciable peak. The standard deviation as calculated by randomly varying the temperature values by the estimated error (\unit[0.06]{K}) 1000 times and then taking the standard deviation of the fitted $m^*$ values.

\end{figure}
Table \ref{Tab:ResD:EffectiveMassResults} also shows gives a result, marked with a dagger, taken with a different field range. These fits give quite different values for the effective mass, indicating that the average field approximation is not a valid one.

\subsubsection{Retrofitting ansatz LK formulae}

The measurements presented in the previous section were further refined using the the ansatz LK formulae as described in section~\ref{Sec:Exp:LKRetrofitting}. \Fig~\ref{Fig:ResD:DingleTermExtractionFits} shows some sample fits used to extract the Dingle terms used in the ansatz fit functions.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{Chapter-dHvABaFe2P2/Figures/Mass/FittingDingleTerm/FittingDingleTerm}
        \caption{Top left panel shows torque data for data taken at \unit[12]{\degree} towards the $[110]$ direction at \unit[0.35]{K} with a polynomial background subtracted. Bottom right shows the FFT and the two filter windows to produce the filtered torque plots in the top right and bottom left. Filtered plots are fitted to extract the Dingle term for each frequency.}

    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Table\ref{Tab:ResD:EffectiveMassResults} lists the extracted Dingle terms for each peak of the Fermi surface and the subsequent results of the retrofitted calculations for the effective masses. The various field limits were chosen in order to either obtain a clearly delimited peak in the lower field cases or to obtain a signal from a weak peak in the higher field cases.


\subsubsection{`Microfitting' the LK formula}

A second attempt at refining the LK fits was performed by applying the microfit technique desribed in section~\ref{Sec:Exp:LKMicrofitting}. $1.5$ oscillations were fit at a time Filtering the data beforehand is not always straightforward due to close proximity of neighbouring peaks. The stronger peaks from the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fermi surfaces show banding of the masses and a clear trending of the results to one of a few values which have been highlighted in yellow. Data in these regions were averaged to give the values in table \ref{Tab:ResD:EffectiveMassResults}.

All filtered using function $\textit{F}_{\textrm{filt}}(x) = \textit{F}(x) \times 1/2 [\tanh{(\pi(x - x_{\textrm{low}})/w)} + \tanh{(-\pi(x - x_{\textrm{high}})/w})]$ where $\textit{F}$ is the Fourier transform of the torque data, $x$ is the dHvA frequency, $x_{\textrm{low}}$ and $x_{\textrm{high}}$ are the lower and upper limits of the filter range respectively and $w$ determines the trail off slope of the filter function. For all measurements $w=10$.

First grey band shows the plain \LK fitted results, following white band details the retrofitted effective mass calculations, following grey band details the microfitted results, and the final band details the band masses from DFT calculations and the three results normalised to these band masses. Result marked with a dagger is repeated with a different field range. Entries marked `NA' had a signal too weak to extract an $\alpha$ value and so microfitting was not possible.}
