The crystalline axes of the sample were determined by \acf{XRD} on a Kappa Apex II single crystal diffractometer by Dr. I. Guillamon and Prof. A. Carrington with the aid of Dr. M. Haddow. The sample was mounted on a glass rod and held in place using vacuum grease. Clear diffraction spots are visible on the example scans shown in figure~\ref{Fig:ResD:XRayDiffraction} although there is some evidence of a second, misaligned phase with the doubling of the spots in a small number of the scans such as the one in the top left panel. There is also further evidence of secondary phases as some peaks are doubled up in the dHvA data presented later. We have no reason to believe however that these speculated misalignments are significantly affecting the rest of the body of results nor that they affect the conclusions in any appreciable way.

Perhaps surprisingly, the straight edge of the crystal was found to lie along the $[110]$ direction and not along the unit cell axis. This was found to be the case for a number of other \BaFeAsP{} crystals which were x-rayed later in the year.

Left shows a zoomed portion of doubled peaks indicating that there may potentially be a misalignment within the crystal. Right inset shows the labelled crystal axes superimposed on the sample which is mounted on a glass rod.}

Lattice parameters are determined using the Apex II software and are presented in table~\ref{Table:ResD:LatticeParams} along with comparisons to two previous measurements found in the literature. The result agree within the error.
