\chapter{dHvA measurements on \BaFeP}
    \label{Sec:ResD}

\begin{chapterabstract}
This chapter presents a close to definitive measurement of the Fermiology of \BaFeP and also presents extensive data and analysis in to the thermal and spin effective masses. Nesting conditions along the $(\pi,\pi)$ vector where investigated through calculations based on insight gained from the measurements and partial nesting was found along $q=(\pi,\pi,k_z)$ where $k_z=0,\pi/2,\pi,3\pi/2,2\pi$. Given \BaFeP is not superconducting this suggests that partial nesting is not a sufficient condition for superconductivity.
