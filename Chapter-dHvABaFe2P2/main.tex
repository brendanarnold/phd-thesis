\chapter{dHvA measurements on \BaFeP}

This chapter presents a definitive measurement of the Fermiology of \BaFeP. It also presents data and analysis for the determination of $m^*_T$ and $m^*_S$. Calculations to determine the Lindhard susceptibility were performed using \ac{DFT} calculations which were adjusted according to the \ac{dHvA} data.
