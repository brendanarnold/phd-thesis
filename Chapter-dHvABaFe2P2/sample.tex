\section{Sample synthesis}

The sample measured is a single crystal of \BaFeP of approximate dimensions $\unit{77}{\micro\metre}\times\unit{54}{\micro\metre}\times \unit{15}{\micro\metre}$ determined by optical microscope\footnote{An image of the crystal mounted on the \ac{AFM} cantilever is shown in the experimental methods chapter}. The crystal was grown by T. Shibauchi in Kyoto using the following technique quoted from Kasahara \etal~\cite{Kasahara2010}

\begin{quote}
\textit{``\ldots Single crystals of \BaFePAs were grown from stoichiometric mixtures of Ba (flakes), and FeAs, Fe, P, or FeP (powders) placed in an alumina crucible, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. It was heated up to \unit{1150-1200}{\celsius}, kept for \unit{12}{\hour}, and then cooled slowly down to \unit{800}{\celsius} at the rate of \unit{1.5}{\celsius\per\hour}. Platelet crystals with shiny [001] surface were extracted \ldots''}
\end{quote}

For the \BaFeP sample used in this experiment, only Ba and FeP would be necessary.
