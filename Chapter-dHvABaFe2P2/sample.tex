\section{Sample synthesis}

Several samples in the \BaFeAsP{} series were measured using \ac{dHvA} at Bristol in the `Yellow magnet' system described in section~\ref{Sec:Exp:YellowMagnet}, however this chapter focuses on a sample of \BaFeP. The sample is a single crystal and has approximate dimensions $\unit{77}{\micro\metre}\times\unit{54}{\micro\metre}\times \unit{15}{\micro\metre}$ as determined by optical microscope\footnote{An image of the crystal mounted on the \ac{AFM} cantilever is shown in the experimental methods chapter.}. The crystal was grown by T. Shibauchi in Kyoto using the following technique detailed in Kasahara \etal~\cite{Kasahara2010}. 

A stoichiometric mixture of Ba flakes and FeP powder was placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. It was heated up to \unit{1150-1200}{\celsius}, kept for \unit{12}{\hour}, and then cooled slowly down to \unit{800}{\celsius} at the rate of \unit{1.5}{\celsius\per\hour}. Platelet crystals with shiny [001] surface were then preferentially extracted and characterised to find single crystals of high crystalline quality.
