The accepted charge carrier in a superconducting condesate is a Cooper pair - a quasi-particle comprising of a bound state of two electrons with opposite spin and momentum. Given that due to their like charge two free electrons repel, it is natural to ask what could overcome the electromagnetic force to cause these electrons to become bound in this state.
