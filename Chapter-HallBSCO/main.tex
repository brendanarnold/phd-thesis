\chapter{Hall measurements on \acs{BSCO}}
    \label{Sec:HallBSCO}

\begin{chapterabstract}
Low (\unit{1.5}{\kelvin}) to high (\unit{300}{\kelvin}) temperature Hall measurements are presented on \ac{BSCO} over a wide doping range spanning the slightly underdoped to the far overdoped. The Hall and resistivity data is modeled using the Ong construction to determine the relative magnitudes of the scattering terms and is found to match the resistivity data within a factor of 2.5 in the underdoped samples. In addition a novel doping assignment scheme based on new \ac{TL2201} \ac{dHvA} results is trialled and was found to give slightly higher dopings than the Ando method which compares room temperature Hall data to \ac{LSCO} and the Presland/Tallon method which scales normalised $T_c$ values to a `universal' parabola.
