\chapter{Hall measurements on \acs{BSCO}}

\begin{chapterabstract}
Low temperature Hall measurements are presented on \ac{BSCO} over a wide doping range spanning the slightly underdoped to the far overdoped. A novel doping assignment scheme based on new \ac{TL2201} data is trialled and was found to give reasonable dopings for \ac{BSCO}. The Hall data at low temperature shows possible linear behaviour at low temperature and interesting evolution of the low $T$ Hall parameters which place constraints on an expected low temperature anisotropic term in either the scattering or the carrier density.
