
\section{Conclusions}

Some interesting constraints are established for the scattering processes affecting in the Hall coefficient as follows,

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preferentially affects the electron or the hole portions of the Fermi surface
    \item If it affects the hole portions only, then it increases with doping beyond \TODO{Blah, can't think anymore}
\end{enumerate}
