The samples were grown by Prof. Takeuchi's group in Sendai University, Japan in May 2009 using the floating zone technique. Here powders of the correct stoichiometry are compacted into a rod and fed slowly through a furnace. A region towards the centre of the furnace heats the powders into a viscous melt, just below this region is a seed crystal. As the end of the rod passes through the melt region, it meets the seed crystal below and solidifies epitaxially onto it. The impurities are held in the melt portion of the crystal. The rod continues to be slowly passed through the melt region, continually solidifying below the region into a single crystal until it reaches the end of the rod and the growth is over. The end portion, containing the impurities is then removed. Similar samples have previously been studied using \ac{ARPES} and \ac{STM} by members of the Sendai group~\cite{Wise2009, Wise2008, Kondo2007, Kondo2005, Kondo2010, Kondo2009, Kondo2006, Kondo2007}.

Table~\ref{Tab:ResH:SampleGrowthDetails} lists the nominal stoichiometries of the samples grown as well as the annealing conditions. Also listed are the \emph{nominal} $T_c$ values for the source crystals which are used to name the samples, the actual measured \Tc values of individual samples for the purposes of doping determination are slightly different due to different definitions of $T_c$\footnote{The source crystals were defined based on the zero value \Tc, the \Tc for doping purposes is defined as the mid-point of the transition with an error based on the difference between the mid-point and the zero-point.}.

The samples are named according the convention,
\begin{quote}
\code{B<Tc>K<UD/OP/OD><Crystal No.><Sample No.>}
\end{quote}
where UD/OP/OD stands for underdoped, optimally doped and overdoped respectively. So for example `B00KOD2A' refers to the sample `A' taken from the crystal `B00KOD2' --- the second overdoped crystal with a $T_c$ of $\unit{0}{K}$.

\section{Size determination}

Thicknesses were determined for some of the samples using the \ac{FIB} or the optical microscope as described in the methods section. The thicknesses used to calculate absolute values of $R_H$ are listed in table~\ref{Tab:ResH:Thicknesses} and are marked in grey. \ac{FIB} results are given for areas as close to the two voltage contacts that were visible in the scans. As can be seen in the example scan shown in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:FIBExamples}, there is some variation in the depth along the sample length.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{Chapter-HallBSCO/Figures/FIBExamples/FIBExamples}
		\caption{Top shows an image composited from several \ac{FIB} scans along the length of sample B00KOD1A, with bottom right showing a detail of the right voltage leg. Bottom left shows an oblique top down view of sample B30KOD3.}
		\label{Fig:ResH:FIBExamples}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The two scans shown are of good quality, however for the purpose of estimating errors in the thickness some of the scans presented problems. Samples B26KOD1A, B28KUD3A, B30KOD2 and B30KUD3 were obscured with the grease applied as part of the pulsed field measurements. Other samples were not correctly earthed such as B28KUD3B which made the images dark, whilst samples B07KOD2 and B32KOP3 were very flaky under close scrutiny. A scan of B30KOD3 showed that it was partially split in the ab plane which may contribute to systematic error in thickness estimate. In all these cases, the estimate in the thickness error was adjusted accordingly to compensate. A more comprehensive set of \ac{FIB} scans, including images of the split in the layers can be found in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:FIBScans}.

The oblique view of B30KOD3 in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:FIBExamples} shows a clear misalignment of the voltage legs to the right of the image. This illustrates why it is necessary to take both positive and negative field sweeps in order to separate the magnetoresistance from the Hall components. This also explains why the length and width determinations were subject to large errors which affects the absolute value of the in-plane resistivity calculations.
