\section{Temperature sweeps}

Figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:TSweeps} shows the in-plane resistivity, $\rho(T)$ for each of the samples in zero field taken in the \ac{VTI} in the \unit{16}{\tesla} `Polo' magnet. Samples were mounted as described in section~\ref{Sec:Exp:SixProbe} for measurement using the six probe technique. The typical contact resistances were of the order of \unit{1}{\ohm} to \unit{10}{\ohm}. All measurements taken in the Polo magnet were taken by the author. From this plot we can characterise the $T_c$ of the samples and find the residual resistivity, $\rho_0$ as well as the linear and quadratic resistivity terms. This is done by using second order polynomial fits to $\rho = \rho_0 + \rho_1 T + \rho_2 T^2$ to the data above the transition temperatures and extrapolate back to zero. Towards the overdoped side the resistivity is affected by a second linear region which signifies the onset of the pseudogap and so a reduced region is fitted which is marked in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:TSweepsPlusFits} which is found by examining the derivative of the resistivity.  Table~\ref{Table:ResH:TSweepFitsParams} show the fit parameters for each of the samples.

The residual resistivities are very good with only one being above \unit{100}{\micro\ohm\centi\metre} and most below \unit{70}{\micro\ohm\centi\metre} which has been cited as being exceptionally good for \ac{BSCO}~\cite{Ando1999}. Moreover the $T_c$ of the optimally doped sample is \unit{36}{\kelvin} which is amongst the highest reported~\cite{Ando1999} which again is testament to the crystal quality.

The mid-transition $T_c$ values were extracted from the plots with the error determined from the difference between the mid point and the zero resistance point. Results are listed in table~\ref{Table:ResH:TSweepFitsParams} as well as the normalised $T_c$ values, $T_c/T_c(\textrm{max})$, with $T_c(\textrm{max}) = \unit{36}{\kelvin}$.

The inset to figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:TSweeps} shows the $\rho(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ values for the samples along with vertical error bars due to uncertainty in the length determination. As we saw in the previous section, there is some misalignment of the voltage contacts which lead to systematic errors in length.

\section{Hall plots}

The low field Hall measurements were taken by the author in Bristol in the Green `Polo' magnet. The high field data was taken over two visits to the \ac{LNCMI} pulsed field facility in Toulouse with the help of Dr. B. Vignolle and Prof. C. Proust. The first trip was conducted by the author and Dr. P. Rourke, the second trip was conducted by Dr. P. Rourke, N. Wakeham, Dr. J. F. Mercure and Prof. N. Hussey. Also included is analysis of data taken by Dr. X. F. Xu, Dr. P. Rourke and I. Mouzoupoulou at the \ac{HFML} in Nijmegen, Netherlands which was obtained with the help of Dr. Alix McCollum. The overarching six-probe measurement technique is used for all the transport measurements with differences chiefly in measurement geometry and apparatus.

Figures~\ref{Fig:ResH:HallIndividualOD}, \ref{Fig:ResH:HallIndividualOP} and \ref{Fig:ResH:HallIndividualUD} show the Hall coefficients extracted as described in the methods section for samples progressing from overdoped, optimally doped to underdoped respectively. Where appropriate, the data is alongside that from Ando \etal~\cite{Ando1999} for comparison. Red lines in the plots are guides to the eye.

For the samples of $T_C \le \unit{28}{\kelvin}$ there are some data which did not reach sufficient field to obtain linear behaviour which are circled with a dashed line in the plots. For sample B30KOD2, many of the sweeps for $T < \unit{45}{\celsius}$ showed significant hysteresis due to temperature drift. Despite temperature correction, many of the fits did not pass through the origin (circled in the figure) which is a good indicator that the true field suppressed linear Hall has not been obtained. The same goes for the circled points on the B30KUD2 plot and another data point at $T=\unit{1.5}{\kelvin}$ and $R_H = \unit{$7.3\times10^{-3}$}{\centi\metre\cubed}$ from the first trip to \ac{LNCMI} which is outside the plot boundary as well as data points on the plot for B28KUD3B. The data sets are combined, minus the points highlighted in the previous paragraph, in the main panels of figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:InvHallCombined} alongside the data from the Ando paper.

\end{figure}

The error bars on the data points do not include error from the thicknesses which are systematic across the data points. The inset of figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:InvHallCombined} shows the $R_H$ values at \unit{300}{\kelvin} vs. doping for each of the samples with these error bars applied. The overall trend in $R_H(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ is downward due to the fact that $R_H(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ values for \ac{TL2201} also trend downwards and the dopings were assigned by matching to this data --- see section~\ref{Sec:ResH:DopingDetermination} for details.

With reference to figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:InvHallCombined} and in particular the new low temperature data points, we see that doping strongly affects the qualitative shape of the $R_H$ curves. The curves have a temperature dependence which is stronger on the underdoped side which gradually becomes less pronounced as doping increases, however all curves show a maximum in $R_H$ at some point along the temperature axis. For the more underdoped samples the behaviour below $R_H(\textrm{max})$ appears linear in temperature, however the error bars preclude resolving if there is a levelling off at \unit{10}{\kelvin} to \unit{20}{\kelvin} which Balakirev \etal{} found in strongly underdoped \ac{BSCO} samples~\cite{Balakirev2003}. The low temperature $R_H$ values all tend towards approximately similar values of around \unit{$0.5\times 10^{-3}$}{\centi\metre\cubed\per\coulomb} to \unit{$1.5\times 10^{-3}$}{\centi\metre\cubed\per\coulomb}. The most pronounced difference between high and low temperature values though is with the optimally doped samples which are around $\times 2.75$ greater at high temperature. None of the curves exhibit a change in sign right down to \unit{0}{\kelvin}.

Figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:RhRatios} shows the ratio of the $R_H(\unit{0}{\kelvin})/R_H(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ values and $R_H(\unit{\textrm{max}}{\kelvin})/R_H(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ values where $R_H(\textrm{max})$ is where the curve reaches its maximum value. We can see relatively little change in $R_H(\textrm{max})/R_H(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ across the dopings, however the low temperature value drops off significantly at around $p= 0.25$ and for the purpose of comparison with literature this corresponds to $p=0.19$ as determined by the Presland/Tallon relation. This coincides to a multitude of phenomena which are thought to be associated with the pseudogap~\cite{Tallon2001}. Since we observe this in the normal state below the superconducting dome, this suggests that the drop is also associated with the pseudogap and that the third scenario described in~\ref{Sec:Intro:Pseudogap} where the pseudogap merges with the superconducting gap at the top of the superconducting dome is not the correct one.


\subsection{Anisotropic model based on the Ong construction}


To try and understand the Hall behaviour and whether this could be a result of an anisotropic scattering term in the overall scattering rate we attempt to model the data based on the Ong construction~\cite{Ong1991} which was detailed in section~\ref{Sec:Theo:TopologyEffects}. We use Fermi surface data obtained by our collaborators by \ac{ARPES} on crystals taken from the same batch~\cite{Kondo2004}. Where data for a particular doping was not available, an interpolation was used between two known dopings. We assume a 2D Fermi surface and that the orthorhombicity is slight enough that we can approximate fourfold symmetry and overlay four point Bezier curves as shown in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:KondoFS} in order to obtain a well behaved analytic function representing the Fermi surface shape. These were checked against data points extracted from the plots in the code and the symmetrised Fermi surface was checked against the original Fermi surface presented in the Kondo paper.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{Chapter-HallBSCO/Figures/KondoFS/KondoFS}
        \caption{Fermi surfaces from the Kondo paper~\cite{Kondo2004} with Bezier curves overlaid spanning 1/8th of the circumference of the Fermi surface}
        \label{Fig:ResH:KondoFS}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We then supposed a three term scattering rate  as $\Gamma = \Gamma_0 + \Gamma_1 \cos^2(2\phi) T + \Gamma_2 T^2$ which includes the anisotropic scattering rate proposed by Abdel-Jawad \etal~\cite{Abdel-Jawad2007} and discussed in section~\ref{Sec:Intro:AnisotropicScattering}. $R_H$ calculated in this way is invariant to scaling of the overall magnitude of $\Gamma$ since the longitudinal conductivity terms cancel the transverse conductivity term. Because of this, we only fit the relative magnitudes of $\Gamma_0$, $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. Keeping the $\Gamma_2$ term constant and adjusting the anisotropic scattering term, $\Gamma_1$, for the Fermi surfaces examined results in an overall scaling of the temperature dependent $R_H$ curve as shown in the right panel of figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:OngBehaviour}. Keeping $\Gamma_2$ constant and increasing $\Gamma_0$ results in $R_H(\textrm{max})$ occurring at higher temperatures as well as a decrease in $R_H$. By first tuning $\Gamma_0$ to obtain the correct temperature at which $R_H(\textrm{max})$ occurs, then tuning $\Gamma_1$ to obtain the correct $R_H(\unit{0}{\kelvin})/R_H(\textrm{max})$ ratio the best match to the curves was determined.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.1]{Chapter-HallBSCO/Figures/OngBehaviour/OngBehaviour}
        \caption{Left panel shows how the temperature dependence of $R_H$ changes when the $\Gamma_0$ scattering term is adjusted. Curves are normalised to their maximum value. Right panel shows the scaling of $R_H$ resulting from the adjustment of the anisotropic $\Gamma_1$ term. Both sets of data were taken using the Fermi surface for UD27K.}
        \label{Fig:ResH:OngBehaviour}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:OngFits} shows the resulting $R_H$ curves. The resulting parameters are shown in table~\ref{Tab:ResH:OngFits} and are expressed as terms of a fit to a longitudinal resistivity curve, i.e. $\rho^{R_H} = \rho_0^{R_H} + \rho_1^{R_H}\cos^2(2\phi)T^2 + \rho_2^{R_H} T^2$. $\rho^{R_H}(T)$ is normalised to match the actual resistivity curves at $T=\unit{300}{\kelvin}$ given in table~\ref{Table:ResH:TSweepFitsParams}. Since the $\cos^2$ anisotropic term is averaged over the Fermi surface to obtain resistivity\footnote{See the conductivity equation in section~\ref{Sec:Theo:TopologyEffects}.}, this introduces a factor of $1/2$ in the $\rho_1$ fitted resistivity term. The $\rho^{R_H}_1$ term is therefore halved to compare with the value from the anisotropic model. Ratios of the values of the two fitting methods are also shown in table~\ref{Tab:ResH:OngFits}.

In general the resulting ratios only match up very approximately, to within an order of magnitude, however the $T$-linear term from the anisotropic model matches the corresponding term from the resistivity reasonably well, ranging between 0.6 and 1.5 times the resistivity values. We see some systematic behaviour with the residual resistivity value, $\rho_0^{R_H}$ being consistently undervalued by a factor of 2 to 10. For the overdoped samples the $T^2$ factor is around 2.6 to 5.9 times higher than expected and for the underdoped samples is up to a factor of 5 lower than the resistivity fits show which suggests that perhaps there is a doping dependence to the $T^2$ term. We also observe an increase the linear in $T$ term with doping and $T_c$ similar to that found by Abdel-Jawed \etal~\cite{Abdel-Jawad2007}. The $\rho_1^{R_H}$ values are plotted in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:G1ScalingTc}. This is encouraging and supports the notion that it may be possible to model the Hall data in the cuprates, in particular the downturn in the Hall coefficient at low temperatures, without requiring the sort of Fermi surface reconstructions proposed by LeBoeuf \etal~\cite{LeBoeuf2011} detailed in section \ref{Sec:Intro:StripeOrderReconstruction}. It should be emphasised however that the data does not preclude the type of scenario described by LeBoeuf \etal.

It may be the case that refinements to the model will result in better agreement between the data and modeling $v_F$ in the scattering rate will have significant effect close to the van-Hove singularity in the overdoped side. A prima-facie analysis suggests that it will enhance the anisotropy and therefore suppress the anisotropic linear in $T$ term towards the overdoped side. Nonetheless a detailed investigation is required to see if this really is the case.

% An alternate explanation based on the Narduzzo paper~\cite{Narduzzo2008} goes as follows. For $p \gtrsim 0.19$, $R_H(\unit{0}{\kelvin}) > R_H(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ as illustrated in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:RhRatios}. If we assume there is not temperature dependent change of the Fermi surface such that would affect $\vect{v_F}$, then this can be explained by an temperature dependent change in scattering that preferentially affects one of the two regions of curvature (hole-like or electron-like) on the Fermi surface i.e. a change in anisotropic scattering. As detailed in the introduction, such scattering is thought to originate in the overdoped side of the phase diagram and is seemingly closely tied to superconductivity. The Narduzzo paper explores this possibility but ultimately could not definitively conclude that the scattering rate is proportional to $\cos^2(2\phi)$ as is the case in the Abdel-Jawad paper~\cite{Abdel-Jawad2007} detailed in the introduction.

% To explain the anisotropy in the van-Hove scenario where the change is thought to come about from a change in the carrier numbers, we must surmise that the flat band does not lie at the same energy all around the Fermi surface in order to achieve this anisotropy --- in effect this leads to a momentum dependent carrier term. This has been observed in cuprates with Plat\'e \etal~\cite{Plate2005} demonstrating in \ac{TL2201} a momentum dependence of the energy of the flat region of the bandstructure that range between \unit{-25}{\milli\electronvolt} and \unit{-40}{\milli\electronvolt}. However, along the $(\pi, \pi)$ direction in this case, the van-Hove peak was suppressed suggesting that scattering too is anisotropic.

% When we consider the ratio of the maximum $R_H$ to the \unit{300}{\kelvin} value also plotted in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:RhRatios} then we see that these values do not vary much at all with doping indicating that the scattering process that suppresses the low temperature Hall values only becomes dominant below the temperature where $R_H(\textrm{max})$ occurs. Moreover we note that the low temperature behaviour of $R_H$ which, although not possible to ascertain for certain due to the scatter in points, appears linear in temperature below $R_H(\textrm{max})$, which suggests that the same process explored above is $T$-linear in behaviour.

% A finally observation is that when the temperatures of the maximums in $R_H$ are plotted in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:RhRatios}, they show a similar doping behaviour to the $\alpha$ fitted exponents.

% The Hall angle is plotted for each of the samples where $B=\unit{0}{\tesla}$ in-plane resistivity data is available in figure~\ref{Fig:ResH:HallAngle} with temperature raised to a fitted exponent, $\alpha$. In the original Chien analysis, $\alpha = 2$ but is allowed to vary here to observe deviations from the expected $T^2$ behaviour. Similar analysis was performed for resistivity data taken at $B=\unit{13}{\kelvin}$ and although these plots are not shown, the fitted $\alpha$ values are plotted in the bottom left subplot along with the $B=\unit{0}{\tesla}$ values. A nominal unitary field was used when calculating $\cot\theta_H$ and only data above the superconducting transition was fitted and is shown in the plots. Note that for the $B=\unit{13}{\tesla}$ case, the Hall data for the optimally doped sample B32KOP1 was compared with resistivity data for sample B32KOP4 which explains the slightly different doping value assigned to it. In this particular instance, it appears that the assignment of the sample B30KUD3 would be more suited to underdoped rather than overdoped.

%         \caption{Hall angle calculated with a nominal field of unity from resistivity data taken in zero field. Plot in bottom left shows the fitted exponent, $\alpha$, vs. doping compared with similar data on \ac{BSCO} from Konstantanovi\'c \etal~\cite{Konstantinovic2000} for both zero field resistivity data and resistivity data taken at \unit{13}{\kelvin} ($\cot\theta_H$ plots for $B=\unit{13}{\tesla}$ not shown)}

% \end{figure}
% With reference to the plot in the lower left, the fitted exponents approximately follow the same downward trend with doping as in \ac{BSCO} data from Konstantanovi\'c \etal~\cite{Konstantinovic2000} up to around $p=0.27$. In particular the $B=\unit{13}{\tesla}$ follows the curve reasonably closely before the upturn at $p=0.31$. Downward deviation from the $T^2$ behaviour at high temperatures (as indicated from a drop in the $\alpha$ exponent) at this point in the phase diagram has been previously interpreted to be due to the saddle point in the \ac{DOS} which is approaching from below the Fermi energy~\cite{Ando2004} which would also explain why there is a recovery toward $T^2$ behaviour between $p=0.27$ and $p=0.31$ as the flat portion of the \ac{DOS} passes above the Fermi energy. This would suggest that the van-Hove singularity peaks in the \ac{BSCO} phase diagram at around $p=0.25$, approximately where the B16KOD1A sample lies and where the room temperature $R_H$ value was also found to be slightly lower than expected. However this occurs at a higher doping than the Hashimoto paper would suggest~\cite{Hashimoto2008} (see figure~\ref{Fig:Intro:VanHoveBSCOLSCO}) and given the proximity of the van-Hove singularity, the low Hall coefficient should not be interpreted a simple indicator of carrier density. 



% There seems to be little evidence of the transition of the doping from $p$ to $1+p$ which agrees with the notion that these dopings lie beyond where the change in the size of the Fermi surface is thought to take place~\cite{LeBoeuf2007}.
