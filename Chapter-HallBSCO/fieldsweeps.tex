The samples were grown and initially characterised by Prof. Takeuchi's group in Sendai University, Japan in May 2009. \TODO{How were the Tc and compositions discovered? What technique was used for the growth?}. Stoichiometric \ac{BSCO} is overdoped. Adding La reduces the number of holes whereas adding Pb increases the number of holes. Also annealing in oxygen decreases the number of carriers depending on how much additional oxygen is absorbed. Table~\ref{Table:ExpH:SampleGrowthDetails} lists the nominal stoichiometries for the sample growth as well as the annealing conditions. The dopings of the crystals range from $p=0.13$ to $p=0.29$ holes per Cu atom.

The samples are named according the convention,
\begin{quote}
\code{B<Tc>K<Region><Crystal No.><Sample No.>}
\end{quote}
so for example `B00KOD2A' refers to the sample `A' taken from the crystal `B00KOD2' --- the second overdoped crystal with a $T_c$ of $\unit{0}{K}$.

\section{Thickness measurements}

Thicknesses were determined for some of the samples using the \ac{FIB} or the optical microscope as described in the methods section. The results for various crystal samples used throughout this thesis are listed in table~\ref{Table:ExpH:Thicknesses}. \ac{FIB} results are given for areas as close to the two voltage contacts that were visible in the scans. As can be seen in the example scan shown in figure~\ref{Fig:ExpH:FIBExample}, there is some variation in the depth along the sample length. Measurements are therefore taken as close to the voltage legs as possible and whre appropriate suitable errors are estimated.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}

		\label{Fig:ExpH:FIBExamples}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The two scans shown are of good quality, however for the purpose of estimating errors in the thickness some of the scans presented problems. Samples B26KOD1a, B28KUD3a, B30KOD2 and B30KUD3 were obscured with the grease applied as part of the pulsed field measurements. Other samples were not correctly earthed such as B28KUD3b which made the images dark, whilst samples B07KOD2 and B32KOP3 were very flakey under close scrutiny. A scan of B30KOD3 showed that it was partially split in the ab plane which may contribute to systematic error in thickness estimate. In all these cases, the esimate in the thickness error was adjusted accordingly to compensate. A more comprehensive set of \ac{FIB} scans, including images of the split in the layers can be found in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:FIBScans}.

The oblique view of B30KOD3 in figure~\ref{Fig:ExpH:FIBExample} shows a clear misalignment of the voltage legs to thr right of the image. This illustrates why it is necessary to take both positive and negative field sweeps in order to seperate the magnetoresistance from the Hall components.

\section{Field sweeps}

Figures~\ref{Fig:ExpH:HallIndividualOD}, \ref{Fig:ExpH:HallIndividualOP} and \ref{Fig:ExpH:HallIndividualUD} show the Hall coefficients extracted as described in the methods section for samples progressing from overdoped, optimally doped to underdoped respectively. Where appropriate, the data is compared to that from Ando \etal~\cite{Ando1999}. For the samples of $T_C >= \unit{28}{\kelvin}$ there are some data which did not reach sufficient field to obtain linear behaviour which are circled with a dashed line in the plots. Examples of data where the temperature control was poor are also circled.

The error bars on the data points do not include error from the thicknesses which are large and systematic across the data points. For this reason, the scalings of each set of sample data are only correct within the errors dues to thickness. For example B07KOD2 has comparable high temperature $R_H$ values to B16KOD1a when the trend is for the more overdoped samples to feature lower $R_H$. This is understandable given that the absolute values for B07KOD2 may be off by up to $~25\%$ for one of the contacts due to the exceptionally thin and flakey sample\footnote{In fact this was the case for the A contact, the maximum $R_H$ value was exceptionally high at \unit{$1.45\times10^{-3}$}{\centi\metre\cubed} approximately \unit{20}{\%} more than expected.}. Similarly, B30KUD3 also has a lower $R_H$ than the trend would suggest given that at \unit{300}{\kelvin}, $R_H$ is lower than the optimally doped sample. For the purposes of comparison, we assume that these two samples are indeed out of their natural order and adjust the thicknesses within the error by $\times0.8$ for B07KOD2 and $\times1.2$ for B30KUD3a. Since these systematic adjustments are relatively large compared to the spread in $R_H$ values between samples,  care should be taken to bear these uncertaities in mind when making quantitative statements about the trends in doping.

With reference to figure~\ref{Fig:ExpH:InvHallCombined} and in particular the new low temperature data points, we see that doping strongly affects the qualitative shape of the $R_H$ curves. Whilst the trend appears to be that $R_H(\unit{300}{\kelvin})$ decreases as doping increases as to be expected, the $R_H(\unit{0}{\kelvin})$ values all tend toward approximately similar values of around \unit{$0.5\times 10^{-3}$}{\centi\metre\cubed}to \unit{$1.5\times 10^{-3}$}{\centi\metre\cubed}. The most proncounced diffreence between high and low temperature values though is with the optimally doped samples which are around $\times 2.75$ greater at high temperature.

There seems to be little evidence of the transition of the doping from $p$ to $1+p$ which agrees with the notion that these dopings lie beyond where the Fermi surface reconstruction is thought to take place~\cite{LeBoeuf2007}. 

%Divergence in resistivity occurs beyond UD 0K\cite{Ando2000}, well
%below our lowest nominal doping of ...

% Residual resistivity of ~20\mu\Ohm cm at optimal doping is very small
