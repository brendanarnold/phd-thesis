\section{The cuprate phase diagram}

Contrary to the recently discovered pnictide materials, the phase diagrams for the cuprates are very similar with principle differences being only in scale. However this universality comes with an greater abundance of features which are not present or at least have not yet been charactersised in the pnictides. Figure~\ref{Fig:Intro:PhaseDiagrams} shows the phase diagram for \TODO{Give a particular example that includes electron doping} in particular but the features are shared between the cuprates. Looking more closely at the hole doping side, which in general is where the superconductivity is more robust, we start in a Mott insulating antiferromagnetic \ac{SDW} state in the undoped parent compound, this gradually dissapates as doping is introduced along the temeprature scale, T$_N$
