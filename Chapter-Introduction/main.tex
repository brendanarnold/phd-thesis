\begin{chapterabstract}
This first part of this chapter starts with a brief general overview of the pnictides with particular focus on the Fermiology of the `122' family and the \BaFeAsP{} series. This includes previous work by the Bristol group and how this relates to spin fluctuation mediated pairing.

The second part of this chapter describes the cuprate phase diagram. In particular it outlines some more contentious regions of the diagram such as the pseudogap and stripe order and how high field transport studies on \ac{BSCO} can elucidate their nature. It also details previous work performed by the Bristol group on \acs{LSCO} and how performing high field measurements on \acs{BSCO} can provide further understanding of the mechanisms at work in the phase diagram.

Motivations for the work carried out in this thesis are also presented.
