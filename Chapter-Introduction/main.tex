This first part of this chapter starts with a brief general overview of the pnictides with particular focus on the `122' family and the \BaFePAs series. This includes a review of the pnictide Fermiology, how this relates to spin fluctuation mediated pairing and how the Fermiology of \BaFeP in particular is important to the understanding of these phenomena.

The second part of this chapter describes the cuprate phase diagram. In particular it outlines some important, apparently conflicting observations and some possible mechanisms to understand them. It also details previous work performed by the Bristol group on \acs{LSCO} and how performing high field measurements on \acs{BSCO} can provide further understanding of the mechanisms at work in the phase diagram.
