\begin{chapterabstract}
This chapter begins by detailing a suitable interpretation of the high-$T_c$ phase diagram which is consistent with the results presented in later chapters. In particular it outlines some important, apparently conflicting results and some possible means to understand them. Following this is an overview of the pairing mechanisms in high-$T_c$ materials and in particular the pairing due to spin-fluctuations.
