\section{Pairing mechaism}
\label{Sec:Intro:PairingMechanism}

Although there is good evidence that the anisotropic scattering term found in the \ac{ADMR} data could well be the scattering responsible for the pairing, the results do not make any claims as tot he nature of the scattering. The \ac{BCS} model explicitly states that the scattering is mediated by phonons in ceonventional superconductors however there are a few resons why this cannot be the sole scattering process in the \highTc materials.

\TODO{List some reasons why phonon is not enough}

Perhaps the most promising the candidate is the scattering off \ac{SDW} fluctuations which occur when a material is on the cusp of shifting into a a \ac{SDW} state.
