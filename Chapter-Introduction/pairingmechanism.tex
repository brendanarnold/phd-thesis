\label{Sec:Intro:Nesting}

The previous section discusses the Fermiology of the iron-pnictides but does not make any statements as to why this is important to the high-$T_c$ problem. In particular how does Fermiology relate to the mechanism which causes the Cooper pairs to couple --- the so called `pairing glue'. 

The charge carrier in a superconducting condensate is a Cooper pair - a quasi-particle comprising of a bound state of two electrons or two holes with opposite spin and momentum. Evidence for this configuration can be shown from the Ginzburg-Landau model which, when applied to a superconducting system, gives the charge of the quasi-particle carriers as $2e$, where $e$ is the charge of an electron~\cite{Annett2010}. Given that due to their like charges two free electrons repel, it is natural to ask what could overcome the electromagnetic force to cause these electrons to remain bound in this quasi-particle state.

Bardeen, Cooper and Schreiffer established much of the theoretical basis --- from which the Ginzburg--Landau model can be derived --- in \ac{BCS} \emph{theory} (named after the authors). Within the framework of \ac{BCS} theory, Bardeen Cooper and Schreiffer wrote a 1957 paper~\cite{Bardeen1957} detailed a pairing mechanism known as the \ac{BCS} \emph{model} which would explain how these electron remained bound together. The model is based around the concept of phonons scattering off electrons which well suited the superconducting materials known at the time. Phenomenologically, the mechanism of attraction is straightforward. Electrons moving through a crystal lattice attract ions on the lattice sites. These heavy ions respond slowly and are drawn in \emph{behind} the electron. This has the effect of both screening the negative electron charge as well as providing an attractive positive potential for any electron following the original electron. The net effect is the leading electron draws the following electron in its wake, thus coupling them with one another. The wavelike distortion of the ions in the lattice can be considered as a phonon, and the interaction between the electrons and the lattice can be modelled as electron--phonon--electron scattering.

The \ac{BCS} model accurately describes what we now know as \emph{conventional superconductivity}, that is pairing which forms a spin-singlet state ($S=0$) and which has zero orbital angular momentum ($L=0$). It was not until the discovery of superfluidity\footnote{Superfluidity and superconductivity share much of the same physics although the superfluid $^4$He molecules are already bosons and so pairing is not required. Parallels between the two are discussed in ref.~\cite{Annett2010}} in $^3$He in 1972~\cite{Osheroff1972} that it became apparent that there may exist forms of pairing that resulted in spin-triplet pairing state ($S=1$) with $L>0$. This was later confirmed when superconducting analogues were found in the form of heavy Fermion materials. What really spurred the explosion in interest though was the 1986 discovery by Bednorz and M\"uller~\cite{Bednorz} of high transition temperature (\Tc) superconductivity in the cuprates and, more recently, the `pnictides' by Kamihara et al.~\cite{Kamihara2008}. The cuprate class of materials that Bednorz and M\"uller found to be superconducting have transition temperatures far in excess of any previously known superconducting materials and although the \ac{BCS} model phonon pairing may play a part, the predominant pairing mechanism in the \highTc materials is likely to be something else entirely.

\subsection{The case against conventional superconductivity in high-$T_c$ materials}

There is a great deal of evidence in the literature for non-\ac{BCS} model pairing in the high-$T_c$ and heavy Fermion materials. Although the pairing wavefunction cannot be measured directly with current techniques, experiments indirectly infer \emph{unconventional} i.e. non s-wave, \ac{BCS}-model, characteristics. For example, analysis on penetration depth measurements of \ac{Y123} show power law behaviour~\cite{Annett1991}, indicating that there exists states within the momentum averaged gap. SQUID measurements and Josephson tunnelling experiments on the same material have confirmed alternating phase of the condensate wavefunction which points strongly to \DxTwoyTwo--wave symmetry~\cite{VanHarlingen1994} (see also refs. therein). As for other cuprate materials, specific heat measurements on \ac{BSCO}~\cite{Wang2011}, as well as penetration depth measurements on LSCO~\cite{Froehlich1996} have also proved consistent with $d$-wave pairing. 

More evidence against conventional superconductivity include the unusual normal state (i.e. non-superconducting) state properties of the cuprates and heavy Fermion materials. The \ac{BCS} model is grounded in Landau Fermi liquid theory which models interacting itinerant electrons with quasiparticles of heavier effective mass than ordinary electrons and holes. A hallmark of Fermi liquid behaviour is a $T^2$ dependence of the resistance, however experiments on the cuprate \ac{LSCO}~\cite{Cooper2009} and a heavy Fermion material~\cite{Custers2003} have demonstrated fractional power law behaviour, $T^\gamma$ where $1 < \gamma < 2$, at temperatures above the superconducting transition. Given that the Fermi liquid model breaks down in these examples, it follows that the \ac{BCS}-model also is likely on shaky ground for these materials.

There are several arguments against phonons as the sole pairing mechanism in the pnictide case, Boeri et al.~\cite{Boeri2008} and Mazin et al.~\cite{Mazin2008} present calculations showing that the magnitude of the phonon pairing strength is not adequate for the high \Tc values attained in LaFeAsOF, Haule et al.~\cite{Haule2008} note in the same material that the gradient of the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level is such that you would expect an increase in DOS and hence \Tc with hole doping if the \ac{BCS} model held, however the reverse is true. Non Fermi-liquid behaviour was demonstrated in the \BaFePAs series~\cite{Jiang2009,Kasahara2010} and although many superconducting pnictides are believed to have a nodeless superconducting gap~\cite{Hashimoto2012,Zhang2011a,Ding2008, Terashima2009} there are many~\cite{Fletcher2009, Qiu2011b, Song2011, Dong2010, Hashimoto2012} including the \BaFePAs series~\cite{Zhang2011,Yamashita2011a,Suzuki2011} which are thought to have nodes.

It is interesting to note that unlike the cuprates which universally show a \DxTwoyTwo gap symmetry, the pnictide materials are note all alike, even pnictides along the same series such as the LiFeAs and LiFeP show a change in gap structure. Consequently, it may prove that the nature of the superconductivity may not be universal amongst the pnictide materials. Irrespective of this, the \ac{BCS} model pairing alone has been shown to be too weak to explain high-$T_c$ superconductivity.


\subsection{Spin-fluctuations}

One possible alternate pairing mechanism arises from scattering due to spin fluctuations. A common feature of phase diagrams for all of the pnictides and the cuprate materials is close proximity of an antiferromagnetic state to the superconducting state as shown in figure~\ref{Fig:Intro:PhaseDiagrams}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

        \label{Fig:Intro:PhaseDiagrams}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
As described in more detail in section~\ref{Sec:Theo:SpinDensityWave}, the \ac{SDW} state is a general form of magnetic order that describes a periodic modulation of the spins of a system and encompasses antiferromagnetism and arguably ferromagnetism. In a system close to a \ac{SDW} state, short range, damped, antiferromagnetic fluctuations occur and it is these that are thought to provide the pairing interaction for the Cooper pair states.

Spin fluctuations were originally investigated as a mechanism which \emph{suppressed} conventional, i.e. $s$-wave, superconductivity~\cite{Berk1966} from ferromagnetic fluctuations and were used to explain why nearly ferromagnetic metals such as Pd has lower than expected $T_c$. Later however it was found that for symmetries such as $d$-wave that \emph{antiferromagnetic} spin fluctuations could possibly provide an interaction which is attractive and could overcome the Coulomb repulsion~\cite{Scalapino1995}.

Typically spin-fluctuations occur due to favourable band structure conditions, in particular where there is a \emph{nesting} condition. This is where a hole-like Fermi surface band maps through reciprocal space onto a similarly sized electron-like Fermi surface via a particular vector $\vect{q}$ known as the nesting vector. Since strong nesting leads to a stable \ac{SDW} state, we are looking for only partial nesting in the Fermi surface of superconducting materials so that we get enough spin fluctuations to cause pairing but not too many to cause a full \ac{SDW} state.

As an aside, nesting is not the only cause of spin fluctuations. For example, frustrated spin systems such as the Kagome triangular lattice can also be a cause of spin fluctuations, however this is thought to occur only in very specific 1D and 2D materials.

\subsection{Pairing in the pnictides}

Soon after the discovery of the pnictide materials, a possible pairing mechanism was proposed based on on the above described spin density wave fluctuations. The original paper suggested a $s_{\pm}$ gap symmetry~\cite{Mazin2008} which features a multi band model based on LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ which matches the semi-metal bandstructure discussed earlier. The spin fluctuation couples over the \ac{BZ} diagonal two separate, approximately cylindrical, Fermi surfaces of opposite phase. 

This is an extended $s$-wave model which satisfies the requirement for opposite phase by having two separate Fermi surfaces of opposite phase which are partially nested. However as already stated, more recent measurements have discovered nodes in the gap structure in many pnictide materials. While no nodes featured in the original Mazin model, the $s$-wave symmetry allows nodes. However the $d$-wave state \emph{requires} nodes and given that, as already stated, some pnictides are nodeless, the $d$-wave symmetry cannot be the correct pairing symmetry across all the pnictide materials~\cite{Mazin2010}.


\subsection{Motivation}
    \label{Sec:Intro:MotivationPnictide}

In order to explore the role of nesting in the high-$T_c$ superconductors, an investigation at Bristol was undertaken on the Fermiology of the \BaFePAs series by studying angle resolved \ac{dHvA} oscillations. This thesis details results in particular on the end-member, \BaFeP. The results elucidate the nature of the hole pockets which according to the \ac{DFT} calculations change topologically much more than the electron pockets throughout the series. This will also provide an interesting comparison to recent measurements on the structurally similar compound SrFe$_2$P$_2$ and CaFe$_2$P$_2$.

We seek to examine if partial nesting is found between the outer hole surface and the inner electron surface with $q=(\pi, \pi, \pi/2)$ meaning the nesting phenomenon persists through to the end member of the series. We also seek to measure the effective masses of the hole pocket in particular to see if they stronger than the relatively weak mass enhancements from the electron pockets thereby indicating strong electron correlations on the hole sheets.

% Strong correlations - the interaction energy is much greater than the kinetic energy for the states
% When correlations present, Cooper pairs are assumed to be pairs of Landau quasiparticles

% The Stoner condition of $\mathcal{N}_0 I > 1$ -- where $\mathcal{N}_0$ is the density of states at the Fermi energy and $I$ is the molecular field constant, that scales the magnetism given a field -- indicates an energy instability\cite{Kubler2000}
