In this section the Hall measurement technique and analysis of the \BSCO samples is described. Transport measurements on superconductors have been performed for over a century now and was the technique by which superconductivity was first discovered. The relative technical simplicity of the measurements makes transport measurements highly appealing considering the wealth of information that can be extracted from a resistance curve.

The charge transport measurements performed for this thesis took place in Bristol in the Green `Polo' magnet for low fields and in the LNCMI pulsed field facility in Toulouse for the high field data. Also included is analysis of data taken by group members\footnote{Dr. X. F. Xu, Dr. P. Rourke and I. Mouzoupoulou} at the high field laboratory in Nijmegen, Netherlands. The overarching six-probe measurement technique is used for all the transport measurements with differences chiefly in measurement geometry and apparatus.

\subsection{Experimental apparatus}

\subsubsection{Six probe technique}

For accurate measurement of voltage, and hence resistance, across a sample, two wires are not sufficient. The wires themselves have a resistance which is comparable or often larger than the resistance of the sample being measured. A solution to this problem is to instead supply the current for the voltage reading via one set of wires, and then take the voltage reading from another set meaning that a minimum of four wires and four contacts on the sample are required. To measure magnetoresistance we require the voltage wires to be placed upstream and downstream of the current, to measure the Hall effect we require the wires to be placed transverse to the current. Moreover it is useful to be able to take two transport measurements at a time so as to get an idea for the homogeneity of the sample and as well to provide some redundancy in case of breakage. Since the \BSCO samples that we studied were to have both measurements, six connection points were placed to each sample as shown in figure~\ref{Fig:Exp:BSCOSampleSchematic}.

        \label{Fig:Exp:BSCOSampleSchematic}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
The connections were made with \unit{20}{\micro\metre} gold wire for the current and \unit{10}{\micro\metre} gold wire for the voltage leads and attached with DuPont 4929 conductive silver paint which dries at room temperature. As shown in the figure, the sample is raised from the quartz substrate so that when the temperature drops and the wires and sample thermally contract at low temperatures, there is some give so that the ensemble does not pull itself apart.

With the four voltage legs a variety of configurations can be achieved. Measuring across (a) and (b) is the magnetoresistance configuration, (a) and (c) is the Hall configuration. It is also possible to measure across (a) and (d) and provided the field is reversed from positive to negative, both the Hall and the magnetoresistance across the sample can be extracted.

Because the connections may not be exactly aligned and because the silver paint in practice tends to whet over the edge of the sample, magnetoresistance contributions may be found in the Hall configuration and vise-versa. For this reason it is generally advised to sweep both with a positive field to obtain $R_{\textrm{pos}}$ and a negative field to obtain $R_{\textrm{neg}}$ where $R$ is the resistance and separate the two out using the technique described in the analysis section.


\subsubsection{Polo magnet}

The `Polo' magnet is an Cryogenic cryostat containing a \ac{VTI} refrigeration device that allows temperature from $\sim$\unit{1.4}{\kelvin} to room temperature to be achieved. The \ac{VTI} system is a vacuum sealed chamber in to which the sample probe is inserted and sealed at the top. This chamber is insulated from a bath of $^4$He in the main cryostat by a vacuum jacket. $^4$He is admitted into the \ac{VTI} chamber from the bath via an adjustable needle valve and is pumped through the chamber and over the sample by an external roughing pump. By almost closing off the needle valve entirely and applying a heater on the sample stage the full range of temperatures can be achieved. In practice, a couple of temperature ranges are defined which require different operational techniques and are specified in table~\ref{Table:Exp:PoloOperation}.
\begin{table}
    \begin{center}
           \caption{Operating the \ac{VTI} under various temperature regimes.}
        \begin{tabular}[htbp]{lp{7cm}}
\toprule
Temperature range & Practice \\
\midrule
\unit{1.4}{\kelvin} -- \unit{4.2}{\kelvin} & Fill \ac{VTI} chamber with helium, close off needle valve and adjust the pumping rate to tune the temperature. \\
\unit{4.2}{\kelvin} -- \unit{300}{\kelvin} & Empty the \ac{VTI} of helium and open the needle valve slightly, only pump a small amount and use the sample heater to set the temperature.  \\
\bottomrule
        \label{Table:Exp:PoloOperation}
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
The \ac{VTI} chamber itself has an electric heater which can be operated separately and is good for rapidly heating the system up to room temperature but is in general too course for measurements.

Heating is controlled by a Lakeshore 340 temperature controller with the sample stage heated from the heater output and the \ac{VTI} heater controlled from the analogue output which has been boosted via a custom built amplifier unit. Sample temperature is monitored by a Cernox mounted onto the sample stage and \ac{VTI} temperature from a thermometer mounted inside the \ac{VTI} chamber.

The sample stage can be rotated from an external stepper motor which is supplied from a custom power source. All the instruments mentioned are controlled from a custom PC running a Delphi program written by Dr. M. French which queues runs and records and displays data. Some calculation is performed inside of the software, however was not configured for these experiments. For this reason the angle and the current fields should be ignored and instead determined by hand.

For twin voltage measurements, two Stanford SR830 lock-in amplifiers were used with one supplying the current and measuring voltage and the second synchronised to the first and also measuring a voltage. The current supplied was supplied through a \unit{1}{\kilo\ohm} buffer resistor in order to approximate the supply to a current source\footnote{i.e. if ($R_{\textrm{sample}} + R_{\textrm{wires}}) << R_{\textrm{buffer}} $ at all $T$, then the current is given by $V_{\textrm{excitation}}/R_{\textrm{buffer}}$.}. The resulting voltages were passed through two passive Princeton Applied Research model 1900 low noise amplifiers set to $\times100$ before measurement although the actual amplification for typical resistances of $10$--$100\Omega$ at \unit{33}{\hertz} is $\times 98$.

The sample probe has a rotating stage and so after aligning the sample roughly by eye, a shallow angle sweep in a low field, typically \unit{1}{\tesla}, was performed before each measurement to make sure the sample was positioned perpendicular to the field. Some samples have an anisotropy in the transport terms and in the case of the Hall component, the effective field drops with the cosine of the angle of misalignment.

The magnet is superconducting and has a limit of \unit{14}{\tesla} or \unit{16}{\tesla} when using the additional cooling of the Lambda plate. For this thesis the measurements were only taken to \unit{13}{\tesla} to minimise the risk of a quench. The field was ramped at \unit{1.4}{\tesla\per\minute}. The measurements presented in this thesis from the Polo magnet are all taken in the Hall configuration and are obtained by averaging both sets of contacts as decribed in the analysis section.


\subsubsection{\ac{HFML} Nijmegen}

To access the normal state of the higher \Tc materials we require fields larger than the \unit{13}{\tesla} available in the Polo magnet at Bristol. The \ac{HFML} facility in Nijmegen has available a continuous field Bitter magnet which can reach \unit{33}{\tesla}. Data from Nijmegen in this thesis was taken in May 2010 by Dr. X. Xu, I. Mouzoupoulou, Dr. P. Rourke and Dr. A. McCollam.

The magnet used at the \ac{HFML} sweeps at a rate of typically \unit{3}{\tesla\per\minute} meaning the temperature can drift significantly. The necessary heating supply for temperature control was alternated between a Lakeshore 340 temperature controller which uses input from a Cernox thermometer and a PID algorithm to supply an appropriate current or a Keithley current source which supplies a fixed current. The current source was selected on a sweep-by-sweep basis depending on which gave more stable temperatures.  The analysis compensates for small drift using a simple correction described later. Since the sweep rate is much lower, the excitation frequency is set to one of the `magic' frequencies\footnote{Frequencies that do not fall near common sources of noise or their harmonics e.g. \unit{50}{\hertz} from mains supply} which in this case were \unit{33}{\hertz}, \unit{77}{\hertz}, \unit{113}{\hertz} and \unit{123}{\hertz}.

The samples were measured using Stanford SR830 lock-in amplifiers which were supplying via \unit{1}{\kilo\ohm} resistors with a \unit{10}{\ohm} shunt resistor. A \unit{1}{\volt} excitation voltage was used for all samples except for B00KOD1a and B16KOD1a where \unit{2}{\volt} excitation was used instead.

Field is monitored using a calibrated Hall probe which is measured using another Stanford SR830 lock-in amplifier.

\subsubsection{\ac{LNCMI} Toulouse}

To obtain the highest fields we took measurements at the \ac{LNCMI} pulsed field facility in Toulouse over the course of two separate visits. Here large capaitor banks are discharged through liquid nitrogen cooled copper resistive magnets to achieve short (few tens of microseconds) but strong fields of up to \unit{60}{\tesla}. Pulses at the stronger end of the scale have more potential for damaging the magnet and take longer to cool down before the next pulse can be taken and so careful consideration is required to the magnitude of pulse undertaken. Typically the cooling time is around 15 to 30 minutes. The field is measured using a calibrated pick-up coil. The first trip took place in June 2009 and involved B. Arnold, Dr. P. Rourke, Dr. B. Vignolle and Prof. C. Proust. the second trip occured in February 2010 and involved Dr. P. Rourke, Dr. J. F. Mercure, Prof. N. Hussey, Dr. B. Vignolle and Prof. C. Proust.

The results are recorded using a pair of Stanford SR830 lock-in amplifiers after passing through an active INA103 pre-amplifer set to a gain of $\times200$. The raw signal for the pulse duration is recorded and the lock-in in algorithm is post-processed in software to avoid wasted pulses due to incorrect settings. The driving current is supplied by the lock-in amplifier and unless otherwise noted is \unit{5}{\volt} through a \unit{1}{\kilo\ohm} resistor giving a current source of \unit{5}{\milli\ampere}. The driving frequency is typically very high to sample the data over the relatively short pulse time and for these experiments is typically \unit{60}{\kilo\hertz}. The data is streamed via an optical link along glass fibres (so the chamber remain electrically isolated for safety during a pulse) to an external PC.

Cooling down to $\sim \unit{1.4}{\kelvin}$ is possible by pumping on the helium in the magnet bath. Higher temperatures could be achieved by pumping out the exchange gas and heating via a Lakeshore 340 temperature controller. Although pulses are very short lived, there is a risk of the rapidly changing field inducing a current in the leads which cause heating of the sample during the pulse. For this reason great care is taken to minimise current loops by minimising the non-twisted portion of the wires leading to the sample. Furthermore, the sample is physically jolted by the high field which can adversely affect the data, for this reason, vacuum grease is carefully applied to the sample ensemble to reduce movement.

For the first Toulouse visit, the measurements were taken in the magnetoresistance configuration, the second Toulouse visit measured the samples in the diagonal configuration.

\subsection{Sample size determination}

The length and the width of the samples were determined from calibrated optical microscope screen captures. The depth was determined post transport measurements with the help of Dr. P. Heard using a \ac{FIB}. This images samples by rastering a focused beam of ions onto the sample surface and measuring the amount of ejected electrons or ions form the image. This process causes electrical charging of the surface which can in turn adversely affect the path of the highly focused incoming ions and so the sample to be imaged must be earthed in order to remain electrically neutral. For these samples, a line of 4929 silver paint was drawn between on of the contacts and the sample mounting puck.

\subsection{Data Analysis}

When measuring transport in a sample, there will always be contributions from both the \ac{MR} and the Hall components due to imperfect geometry


Generally, the Hall and \ac{MR} components can be separated out provided the feidl sweeps

\begin{align}
R_{\textrm{Hall}} &= \frac{1}{2}( R_{\textrm{pos}} - R_{\textrm{neg}} ) \\
R_{\textrm{MR}} &= \frac{1}{2}( R_{\textrm{pos}} + R_{\textrm{neg}} )
\end{align}
