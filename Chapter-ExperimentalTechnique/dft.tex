\label{Sec:Exp:Dft}

Calculations presented in this thesis were performed using \WIEN version 07.2 (20th Feb 2007)~\cite{Blaha2001} using \ac{LAPW} without the local orbitals. Unless specified, non-spin orbit calculations are presented although spin-orbit calculations were checked and did not show significant differences. The \ac{GGA} according to Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof~\cite{Perdew1996} was used for the exchange distribution.

Preprocessing of the WIEN2k data into voxel form as well as the theoretical angle plots were performed using a modified version of MATLAB code written by Dr. Ed Yelland. The basis for the code has been thoroughly field tested within the group over a number of years.
