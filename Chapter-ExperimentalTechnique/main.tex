\chapter{Experimental and Computational\\Methods}

\begin{chapterabstract}
This chapter begins with descriptions of how the \ac{dHvA} measurements were performed, the equipment used and the analysis. Next, a description of the methods and code used to calculate susceptibility is supplied and finally descriptions of the magnetotransport measurements and analysis are detailed.
