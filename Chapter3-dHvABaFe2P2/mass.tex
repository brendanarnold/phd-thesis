\subsubsection{Basic LK formula fitting}

A series of field sweeps were taken with $H$ at \unit[12]{\degree}, \unit[28]{\degree} and \unit[46]{\degree} from $[001]$ in the $[110]$ direction. These were performed at a variety of temperatures from base ($\approx\unit[0.3]{K}$) to above \unit[2]{K}. \Fig~\ref{Fig:3:ExampleLKFits} shows the Fourier amplitude of various peaks as a function of temperature along with fits to equation~\ref{Eqn:2:TempTermOscillationAmp}. The field range for the FFT was was necessarily large enough that individual peaks did not overlap and also could be observed across a reasonable range of temperatures but also small enough so that the $B$ dependent Dingle factor did not play too large a role and so an average $B$ field can be assumed.

However similar fits using a different FFT interval give quite different values for the effective mass, indicating that the average field approximation is not a valid one.

\subsubsection{Retrofitting ansatz LK formulae}

The measurements presented in the previous section were further refined using the the ansatz LK formulae as described in section~\ref{Sec:2:LKRetrofitting}. \Fig~\ref{Fig:3:DingleTermExtractionFits} shows some sample fits used to extract the Dingle terms used in the ansatz fit functions.

Table\ref{Tab:3:DingleTerms} lists the extracted Dingle terms for each peak of the Fermi surface.

\subsubsection{`Microfitting' the LK formula}

A second attempt at refining the LK fits was performed by applying the microfit technique desribed in section~\ref{Sec:2:LKMicrofitting}. Filtering the data beforehand is not always straightforward due to close proximity of neighbouring peaks. The stronger peaks from the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fermi surfaces show banding of the masses and a clear tending of the results to one of a few values which have been highlighted in yellow.
