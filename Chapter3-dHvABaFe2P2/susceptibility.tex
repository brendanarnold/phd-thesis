To verify that we do get enhanced susceptibility, leading to a spin-density wave state, the $q$-dependant susceptibility -- described in section \ref{Sec:1:NestingSusceptibility} -- was calculated. Since the Lindhard function takes the sum over all energies in the Brillouin zone, there may be some concern that the rather crude adjustments to the DFT calculations performed in the previous section -- which have only been verified to be correct for energies at the Fermi surface -- may give erroneous results. However the nature of the Lindhard function means that far greater weight is given to energies that are near the Fermi surface and so, assuming that the energy dispersion does vary smoothly close to the Fermi level, any differences away from the Fermi level should not be a cause for concern.

Code to calculate the Lindhard susceptibility was written in MATLAB (Appendix \ref{Appendix:SusceptibilityCode} contains the full code) and early versions were tested with free electron cases in 2 and 3 dimensions with results shown in \fig\ref{Fig:3:FreeElectronSusceptibility}. This matches the expected free electron curves\footnote{See, for example, page 126 and Appendix F of reference\cite{Dressel2002}}. One caveat when dealing with the free electron case is that the energy dispersion is not periodic and as such needs to be truncated at some point in a spherically symmetric way. This truncation affects the final calculation but provided it occurs far enough from the Fermi surface then the difference is minimal. The results shown are for a calculated region that was a sphere of radius 1 with a Fermi surface radius of 0.3. Values for $\delta(=1e-9)$ and $\omega(=1e-9)$ are chosen to be small compared to the   are somewhat arbitrary given that the dispersion is simplified with $\hbar^2/2m = 1$ but are given for posterity. 

The code was adapted to accept output generated by WIEN2k where the energy dispersion is already calculated. In this case, the dispersion is periodic and energies at the scattering vector $q$ are obtained by simply `rolling' the 3D matrix of energy values. Further testing was performed by re-creating WIEN2k calculations on LaFeAsO$_{0.1}$F$_{0.9}$ performed by Mazin et al.\cite{Mazin2008} and then comparing our own susceptibility calculations with the calculation in the Mazin paper. A temperature smearing of \unit[1]{mRy} was quoted in the Mazin paper which was equated, using the Boltzman conversion, to a temperature of \unit[157.88]{K}. A similar amount of points ($55\times55\times26$) was also used. The result of the WIEN2k calculations are almost exactly equivelent as is evident in the comparisons of the spaghetti plots in top panels of \fig\ref{Fig:3:MazinX0Comparison}. The spacing of the points in the spaghetti plot is indicative of the courseness of the energy grid and fitting a parabola energy dispersion (shown in orange) we can understand, approximately, the magnitudes of the effects of temperature ($T$), quasiparticle lifetime ($\delta$) and the frequency of the perturbing field ($\omega$) on the Lindhard susceptibilty, all of which will be discussed later. The lower panels of \fig\ref{Fig:3:MazinX0Comparison} show comparisons of $\Re\chi_0(q,\omega)$ and $\Im\chi_0(q,\omega)$ with the results of Mazin. For these calculations a variety of

Applying a temeprature smearing to the function is useful to gloss over the finite element size in the calculation which can cause significant spikes in the results. \Fig\ref{Fig:3:SusceptibilityTempSmearing} shows the smearing at particular temperatures. The choice of temperature depends on the granularity of your model as well as the expected fine detail of the results. For our calculations a temperature of \unit[158]{K} was used which corresponds to \unit[1]{mRy} which was the smearing used in a similar investigation into LaFeAsO using a comparable number of data points\cite{Mazin2008}.

Calculations were performed in MATLAB using a $93\times93\times93$ grid of energy values that covered the first Brillouin zone. A small $\delta$ of $10^{-6}$ was included in order to obtain the imaginary component of the susceptbility.
