
\section{Conclusions}

Similar differences between the measured data and calculations were observed for the sister 122 compound SrFe$_2$P$_2$\cite{Analytis2009} and is entirely consistent with results obtained on the entire \BaFePAs series\cite{Shishido2010}. Notably however, the non-nested 122 pnictide compound CaFe$_2$P$_2$ does not show any such differences to the DFT calculations, suggesting that perhaps the shifts in energy may arise from spin-fluctuations.

Orbital character is negligible for s and p orbitals for all bands which confirms ...

Energy shifts for band $2$ are proprtional to the \DzTwo and \DxzDyz characters, implies there may be a link between the \kz scattering and energy enhancements.
