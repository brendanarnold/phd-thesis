The crystalline axes of the sample were determined on a Kappa Apex II single crystal diffractometer with the help of Mairi Haddow. The sample was mounted on a glass rod using vacuum grease during the measurements.

        \caption{Top left, top right and bottom left show example diffraction patterns of the \BaFeP sampple. Top-left shows a zoomed portion of doubled peaks indicating that there may potentially be a misalignment within the crystal. Bottom right shows the labeled crystal axes superimposed on the sample which is mounted on a glass rod.}

Table~\ref{Table:3:LatticeParams} shows the lattice parameters as determined by the x-ray measurements.
