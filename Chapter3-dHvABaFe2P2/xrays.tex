The crystalline axes of the sample were determined on a Kappa Apex II single crystal diffractometer with the help of Mairi Haddow. The sample was mounted on a glass rod using vacuum grease during the measurements. Clear diffraction spots are visible on the example scans shown in \fig\ref{Fig:3:XRayDiffraction} although there is some evidence of a second, misaligned phase with the doubling of the spots in a small number of the scans such as the one in the top left panel. There is further evidence of a secondary phase as some peaks are doubled up in the dHvA data presented later. However it appears that the affects are minor and do not influence the overall measurements and conclusions in any appreciable way.

        \caption{Top left, top right and bottom left show example diffraction patterns of the \BaFeP sampple. Top-left shows a zoomed portion of doubled peaks indicating that there may potentially be a misalignment within the crystal. Bottom right shows the labeled crystal axes superimposed on the sample which is mounted on a glass rod.}

Table~\ref{Table:3:LatticeParams} shows the lattice parameters as determined by three sets of x-ray measurements along with comparisons to previous measurements found in the literature.
