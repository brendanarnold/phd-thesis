\subsection{Determining experimental parameters}

Preliminary measurements showed very strong dHvA oscillations which begin at relatively low field.  An example of the raw data can be seen in \fig~\ref{Fig:3:RawOscillations}. Since it is not clear from the raw torque data where the oscillations begin, Fourier transforms were taken with small (\unit[1]{T}) field intervals --- the interval where a clear signal is present marks the onset of oscillations. A FFT of the data for the ranges \unit[4-5]{T}, \unit[5-6]{T} and \unit[6-7]{T} are shown in the insets of the figure. The range \unit[6-7]{T} clearly shows the electron peaks at around \unit[1500]{T} and \unit[2450]{T}, with the higher frequency peak disappearing in the \unit[5-6]{T} range and both peaks disappearing in the \unit[4-5]{T} range. Further refinement suggests the onset of appreciable oscillations is around \unit[5.6]{T} for the strongest electron peak. The field was ramped between \unit[6]{T} and the safe maximum of \unit[18]{T} for the vast majority of measurements bar some sweeps where the magnet was ramped to or from \unit[0]{T} following or preceding shut-down of the magnet.

 \Fig\ref{Fig:3:ComparisonSweepRates} shows some example Fourier transforms of data taken at various field sweep rates and plotted with the frequencies shifted arbitrarily for ease of comparison. The difference in amplitude between the sweeps at \unit[0.05]{T/min.} and \unit[0.1]{T/min.} is less than \unit[1]{\%} whereas the difference when sweeping at \unit[0.2]{T/min.} is nearly \unit[5]{\%}. Unless otherwise stated, subsequent sweeps were performed at \unit[0.1]{T/min.}.

In order to make a reasonable determination of the Fermi surface of a material, an appropriate number of angle sweeps need to be made to adequately constrain the shape of the Fermi surface. Since \BaFeP is a tetragonal system, any sweep from the azimuthal direction $[001]$ down the polar plane effectively expands to four due to the fourfold symmetry. Measurements were taken at one degree intervals from $H\parallel[001]$ down to $H\parallel[100]$ and from $H\parallel[001]$ down to $H\parallel[110]$ which, in this system, effectively amount to eight sweeps.

The magnetic field was alternatively ramped up and then down meaning subsequent measurements were generally performed with the magnetic field ramping in opposite directions. Although in theory this should not affect the results in any way, subsequent FFT peaks appeared to alternately be shifted by up to $\sim\pm$\unit[21]{T} with the magnitude of the shifts being roughly proportional to frequency. Assuming that the shifts were an artefact of the measurements, a linear correction determined by visual inspection was applied of $F_{\textrm{corr.}} = 3 + \frac{10}{8000} F_{\textrm{meas.}}$ for the sweep in the $[100]$ direction and $F_{\textrm{corr.}} = 0 + \frac{21}{8000}  F_{\textrm{meas.}}$ and  $F_{\textrm{corr.}} = 0 + \frac{18}{8000} F_{\textrm{meas.}}$ for the two sets of measurements performed to complete the sweep in the $[110]$ direction.

\Fig~\ref{Fig:3:FFTExamples} shows three example FFTs which show peaks from all the principal bands identified the next section. They also show first and second harmonics\footnote{Third harmonics were also identified in other FFTs, these are shown in \fig~\ref{Fig:3:AngleSweepMeasured}.}. The low frequency region in \fig~\ref{Fig:3:FFTExamples} shows noise from the cantilever, but according to DFT fits performed in the next section, this region also likely contains signal from the minimum of band $1$. Given that the signal from electron bands is generally small due to high scattering rate, we were not able to extract a convincing Fourier peak.

\Fig~\ref{Fig:3:AngleSweepMeasured} shows the set of peak data after having the angle determined as described in section~\ref{Sec:2:AngleCorrection}. The points marked in grey are the harmonics which were identified by overlaying the measured data on itself after doubling and tripling of the frequency. Signal can be observed up to relatively high angles for the torque technique ($R_T \propto \sin{\theta}$) with peak observed almost up to $80\degree$  in the $[110]$ direction which, along with the observation of third harmonics, and the onset of oscillations in relatively low field is further testament to the quality of the crystal.

\Fig\ref{Fig:3:SubstitutionComparison} shows the measured rotation data which has been matched up to corresponding orbits in the DFT calculations (see next section). Superimposed is the data from the $x=0.63$ data in the \BaFePAs series multiplied by amounts commensurate to the expected shifts in the Shishido paper\cite{Shishido2010}. We can see that while the size of the areas changes between the two values, the overall shape of the $x=0.63$ data matches reasonably well with the data for $x=1$ for bands 2, 3 and 4 at least. Assuming that nothing exotic happens in the intermediary, we can extrapolate the shape of these Fermi surfaces across the range by applying the known electron Fermi surface areas and the compensation condition. This is explored further in the next section.

\subsubsection{Rigidly shifting the calculated DFT energies}
    \label{Sec:3:DFTShifts}

\Fig\ref{Fig:3:AngleSweepMeasuredUnshifted} shows the DFT calculations performed using the augmented plane wave method plus local orbits method method as implemented in the WIEN2k package\cite{Blaha2001}. The unit cell used was that measured by Rotter et al. which are listed in table~\ref{Table:3:LatticeParams}. The calculations were processed into rotation plots using the MATLAB code originally written by Dr. Ed Yelland. Results are shown superimposed over the measured data. By factoring the frequency with $\cos{\theta}$ it becomes clearer which of the orbits is a maximal extrema and which is a minimal extrema. Using this knowledge as well as clues from the Fourier amplitude of the measured data, it was possible to separate out individual bands which have been colour coded and labelled --- according to literature convention --- as specified in table~\ref{Table:3:BandNaming}. Minimal extrema are sub-labelled $1$, maxima are sub-labelled $2$.

As with previous DFT calculations in the \BaFePAs series, the calculated values are consistently higher than the measured values. The exception in this case is $\gamma_2$ which is not much different from the calculated values.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

For the $[110]$ direction it became apparent from the fact that the DFT and the measured curves were qualitatively different that the field was not perfectly aligned with the $[110]$ axis of the sample. By assuming that the measurements were taken from the $c$-axis direction down to a vector rotated \unit[10]{\degree} within the $ab$-plane from the $[110]$ direction, the DFT data matches much better. A \unit[10]{\degree} misalignment is within the estimated alignment error for the microscope images. The data will continue to be labelled as in the $[110]$ plane however for convenience.

As is shown in \fig~\ref{Fig:3:AngleSweepMeasuredUnshifted}, the rotation plots from the DFT calculations match up qualitatively with the data but do not match up quantitatively -- the electron bands overestimating the size of the measured extremal orbits.

In order to obtain the correct shape of Fermi surface, the DFT calculations need to be tweaked. One technique is to apply small band-specific rigid energy shifts, which, in most cases is enough to bring the DFT in line with the experimental data. \fig~\ref{Fig:3:AngleSweepRigidShift} shows the rotation plots which rotate towards both the 100 and 110 directions along with appropriately shifted calculations. Table~\ref{Table:3:EnergyShifts} lists those energy shifts.

        \caption{Rigid energy shifts required to match the DFT calculations with the measured data.}

        & Narrow & -0.0038     \\

Band $2$ in this case has two separate shifts specified in two different regions of the Brillouin zone. The rotation plot for the wider orbit located at the edge of the Brillouin zone was calculated with no energy shift and the narrow part of the Fermi surface around the $\Gamma$ point was calculated with a shift of $0.0038\unit{Ry}$. This provides a reasonable match for the rotation plot where we can apply the shift to the two regions discretely, however is proves problematic when we wish to study intermediate areas since it is not clear how the Fermi surface varies between the two regions. A technique for applying appropriate energy shifts throughout the Brillouin zone is explored in the next section.

In the first place, these shifts were applied as they conveniently and effectively corrected the Fermi surface energies, however the question arises as to whether there is any physical significance to be attached to them. The technique of rigid energy corrections has been applied to previous measurements on LaFePO\cite{Carrington2009} and SrFe$_2$P$_2$\cite{Analytis2009} both of which are highly two dimensional systems that exhibit relatively strong nesting characteristics. This is in contrast with measurements on CaFe$_2$P$_2$\cite{Coldea2009} which has a highly three dimensional Fermi surface and no nesting vector. Furthermore the bulbous area of the three dimensional hole surface in \BaFeP which does not nest requires no shifting of the Fermi surface to match DFT calculations, whereas the nested neck portion does require a shift. This correlation between nesting and shifts in calculated energy make the spin-density-wave fluctuations that are associated with the nesting phenomena an obvious candidate for the cause of the discrepancy between DFT calculation and experiment.

\subsubsection{Shifting the DFT calculations proportional to orbital character}
\label{Sec:ShiftingDFTPropToOrbitalCharacter}

\Fig~\ref{Fig:3:Band2DCharacter} shows the strength of various d-orbital band characters taken on a 110 cut through the \BaFeP Brillouin zone with the band $2$ Fermi surface superimposed. Band characters for the other bands presented in a similar way can be found in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:BandCharacter110Slices}.

        \label{Fig:3:Band2DCharacterVsKz}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Band $2$ has very little basel-plane \Dxy and \DxTwoyTwo character close to the Fermi level but shows a significant amount of \DzTwo character at the wide region of the Fermi surface and \DxzDyz character at the narrow region. \Fig~\ref{Fig:3:Band2DCharacterVsKz} shows the orbital character for each of the $d$-orbitals as a function of \kz traced along the Fermi surface. Evidently, energy shifts could be applied which are scaled to either the \DzTwo and \DxzDyz orbital character in order that we obtain a smooth energy shift transition between the narrow and wide regions discussed previously. 

Energy shifts were applied across the full three dimensional Brillouin zone for band $2$ using the following two scalings which were determined by trial and error fitting of the data,
%%
\begin{align*}
\textrm{\DzTwo:}\quad \Delta\epsilon &= 0.002 - 0.0052 \left(1 - \frac{\epsilon - 0.033}{0.2205 - 0.033}\right) \\
\textrm{\DxzDyz:}\quad \Delta\epsilon &= 0.002 - 0.0052 \left(\frac{\epsilon - 0.0946}{0.3135 - 0.0946}\right)
\end{align*}
%%
Note that these scalings ensure that the energy shift applied varies between \unit[-32]{mRy} and \unit[2]{mRy} which are slightly different to the values applied when rigidly shifting the band. This is due to the fact that the Fermi surface area measured in the narrow region is affected more and more by the size of the Fermi surface in the wide region (and vice-versa) as the azimuthal angle gets higher. The calculated area deviates from the measured area which results in the crossing of the calculated rotation plot with the measured rotation plot shown in the first panel of \fig~\ref{Fig:3:Band2DCharacterRigidComparison}. So when the rigid shifts were being determined, values were chosen which best lines up along the full length of the curve -- one which will be slightly lower than if we were to match the plots exactly at $\theta=0^\circ$.

The final corrections show the DFT calculations being adjusted in size only for the electron and inner hole surfaces with overall shrinking of volume, the outer hole surface is adjusted in shape as well. Volume calculations give the following values for each of the surfaces as a percentage of the Brillouin zone ....

%TODO Calculate volumes of the Fermi surfaces

An interesting condition can be seen from \fig\ref{Fig:3:ZSlices} where we observe cross sections of the final corrected Fermi surfaces showing the basel-plane at the bottom of the unit cell ($\kz=0$), quarter of the way up, ($\kz=0.25$) and halfway up ($\kz=0.5$). The inner hole surface at $\kz=0.5$ directly matches the size and shape of the inner electron surface at $\kz=0.25$. Moreover both surface share similar predominant \DxzDyz orbital character. Both surfaces have different \kz dispersions which mean nesting along the vector of $q=(\pi, \pi, \pi/2)$ is only partial thus providing the right conditions necessary for possible pair forming spin-density-wave fluctuations.

\subsection{Harmonic parametrisation of the Fermi surface}
    \label{Sec:3:TightBindingFits}

An analytic form for the Fermi surface can be obtained using a harmonic expansion of sin and cosine functions as described by Bergemann et al\cite{Bergemann2000}. Primarily this was done so as to provide a convenient way to reconstruct the Fermi surface without necessitating DFT calculations however the coefficients also bear some relation to the tight binding model hopping integrals, although for strongly correlated systems the tight binding model is generally a poor one to use as it entirely ignores electron correlations. The expansion is as described as,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eqn:3:HarmonicExpansion}
k_F(\phi, \kappa) = \sum_{\substack{\mu,\nu \geq 0 \\ \mu \textrm{even}}}
    k_{\mu\nu}\cos\nu\kappa 
    \begin{cases}
        \cos{\mu\phi} \hspace{8pt} &(\mu\mod4 = 0) \\
        \sin{\mu\phi} \hspace{8pt} &(\mu\mod4 = 2)
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $k_F$ is the Fermi surface in k-space, $\kappa = ck_z/2$, $c$ is the unit cell height and $\phi$ is the polar angle.

The two dimensional fits were performed using a least square fitting routine using MATLAB on the DFT data shifted as described in the previous section. Residuals are shown in figure\ref{Fig:3:TightBindingResiduals}. The number of terms for the fits were increased until the residuals ceased to change appreciably. Fit parameters are presented in table\ref{Table:3:HarmonicParams}. Due to the skewed nature of the \kz dispersion of the outer hole surface $20$ terms were necessary to obtain a reasonable fit to the corrected DFT data however electron surfaces could be fitted well with $9$ terms and the inner hole surface with $10$ terms. The final analytical function was then used to create a false energy dispersion on a discrete grid of $k$-points. Extremal orbits were then calculated as a check of how well it matches the original data. The results of this are presented in \fig\ref{Fig:3:TightBindingFitRotationPlot}. The analytical function deviates from the measured data at higher angles implying that the
