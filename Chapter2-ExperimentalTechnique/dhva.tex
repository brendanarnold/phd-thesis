\subsection{Theory}

\subsubsection{Landau levels}

For a free electron gas, the solution to the Hamiltonian is a series of plane waves whose wavenumbers, $\vect{k}$, form a uniform grid in k-space with spacing dependant on the real space unit cell dimensions. When a field is applied, the momentum operator is modified into the canonical momentum operator $\op{p} = -i\hbar\nabla + e\op{A}$, where $\Nabla \cross \vect{A} = \vect{B}$. By chosing an appropriate value for $\vect{A}$ it is possible to solve the simpliefied Schr\:odinger equation to obtain eigenvalues\footnote{A derivation using the Landau guage can be found in ref. \cite{Blundell2001} pages 148--149},
%%
$$E=(l+1/2)\hbar\omega_c + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2_z}{2m_e}$$
%%
where $\omega_c = \frac{eB}{m_e}$ is the \textit{cyclotron frequency}} and $l$ is a quantum number which defines a particular \textit{Landau level}.

The field re-distributes the grid of $\vect{k}$ vectors into degenerate, discrete rings with each ring corresponding to a Landau level. In the process of grouping the uniform grid into discrete energy levels, some of the k-vectors on the grid are shifted up in energy to meet the closest Landau level and others are moved down in energy and for most levels, the resulting increase in energy for an electron matches and cancels a similar downshift in energy for another electron. If however, the closest Landau level lies just above the Fermi energy, then the electrons in that case are all shifted down to the next level resulting in a net decrease in total energy of the k-states in the system.

By considering the degeneracy of the Landau levels





\begin{equation}
A(B,\phi,\theta,T)=A_0R_{\Gamma}R_TR_DR_{\textrm{mos}}R_{\textrm{dop}}R_sR_{\textrm{warp}}
\label{Eqn:2:OscilllationAmp}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
R_T(B, \theta, T) &= \frac{X}/{\sinh{X}} \\
X                 &= \frac{2\pi^2k_Bm^*_{\textrm{therm}}T}{e\hbar B\cos{\theta}} \\
\label{Eqn:2:TempTermOscillationAmp}
\end{align}

\subsection{Mapping the Fermi surface}

\subsubsection{Background removal}
% TODO: Removal of background should not be done against 1/B as a rule.
% Include investigation as to low frequency peak
Previous standard practice was to remove a background polynomial fitted to the field or inverse field from the raw data before taking the FFT. \Fig\ref{Fig:2:BackgroundSubtraction} shows raw torque data taken over a range of angles\footnote{See section\ref{Sec:3:AngleDependentMeasurements} for full details} and a strong $H^2$ component can be observed as a result of the $R_{\Gamma}$ term in equation\ref{}. Subtracting a second order polynomial fitted to the \textit{inverse} field leaves a large artificial angle-dependant oscillation in $1\H$ in the residual which may be misconstrued as a signal from a low frequency Fermi surface orbit. For this reason it is recommended to subtract a second order polynomial fitted to field rather than inverse field for torque measurements.

Centre panel shows the FFT vs. angle for data with the 2nd order polynomial fitted to $1/H$ removed. A strong angle dependant peak at low frequency is seen. Right panel shows the same data but with a second order polynomial fitted to $H$ removed.}

\subsection{Measuring the band mass}

\subsubsection{Basic LK formula fitting}

Of all the damping terms in the \LK equation, only $R_T$ has any kind of temperature dependancy. This term also features the effective mass. By measuring oscillations at a fixed angle but with varying temperatures, the effective mass can be determined. However there is a difficulty in that in-order to observe oscillations, it is necessary to sweep the magnetic field, and many other damping terms have a field dependancy. To the first approximation, an inversely averaged applied field can be used in the \LK equation provided that the field sweep range is small. However there are a couple of techniques that were employed in order to overcome this shortcoming.

\subsubsection{Retrofitting ansatz LK formulae}
\label{Sec:2:LKRetrofitting}

One of the primary field-dependant contributions to the oscillation amplitude is the Dingle term scattering (equation \ref{Eqn:2:DingleTermOscillationAmp}). This has an exponential dependance with temperature. The Dingle factor, $\alpha$, can be determined by fitting a simplified version of equation \ref{Eqn:2:OscillationAmp} to oscillations which have been filtered to reduce the number of fitting parameters. Once we have the Dingle term, a series of ansatz data TODO...

\subsection{Yellow Magnet}

dHvA Measurements were all performed in Bristol on the `Yellow Magnet' system which was built by Oxford and can nominally operate up to \unit[20]{t} with use of the lambda plate although more typically is operated up to \unit[18]{T}. The sample sites on a one axis rotator and angle is determined by one of two orthogonal pick-up coils mounted on the sample stage weak, oscillating magnetic, field in
