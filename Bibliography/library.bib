@article{Meng2010,
abstract = {We study the electronic structure of Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d samples in a wide range of doping, using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our emphasis is on the Fermi surface in the near anti-nodal region. The "nesting wave vector", i.e. the wave vector that connects one nearly flat piece of the Fermi surface in the anti-nodal region to the other adjacent piece, reveals a monotonic decrease in magnitude as a function of doping. Comparing our results to the charge order recently observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we conclude that the Fermi surface nesting and the charge order pattern seen in STS do not have a direct relationship, and therefore the charge order is likely due to strong correlation physics rather than weak coupling Fermi surface nesting physics.},

The former is characterized by two well-defined spectral peaks in ARPES due to coherent bilayer splitting and superlinear behavior in the resistivity, whereas the latter is characterized by a single broad spectral feature in ARPES and a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity.},

abstract = {We performed inelastic neutron scattering on powder sample of the P-doped iron-based superconductor BaFe2(As0.65P0.35)2 with Tc = 30K, whose superconducting (SC) order parameter is expected to have line nodes. We have observed spin resonance at Q \$\backslash sim\$ 1.2\{$\backslash$AA\}\^{}\{-1\} and E=12 meV in the SC state. The resonance enhancement, which can be a measure of the area of sign reversal between the hole and electron Fermi surfaces (FSs), is comparable to those of other iron-based superconductors without line nodes. This fact indicates that the sign reversal between the FSs is still dominant in this system, and the line nodes should create only limited area of sign-reversal on a single FS. Hence the system can hold relatively high-Tc. Comparison with theoretical calculation indicates horizontal line nodes may be a candidate to reproduce the observation.},

We show that, despite the shrinking of the Fermi surfaces with respect to first-principle calculations, the charge-carrier concentration in each band is almost unchanged, with a substantial conservation of the total optical sum rule. However, a significant transfer of spectral weight occurs from low-energy coherent processes to incoherent ones, with practical consequences on the experimental estimate of the sum rule, that is carried out integrating the data up to a finite cut-off. This has profound consequences both on the absolute value of the sum rule and on its temperature dependence, that must be taken into account while discussing optical experiments in these systems.},

abstract = {The presence or absence of a quantum critical point and its location in the phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors have been subjects of intense scrutiny. Clear evidence for quantum criticality, particularly in the transport properties, has proved elusive because the important low-temperature region is masked by the onset of superconductivity. We present measurements of the low-temperature in-plane resistivity of several highly doped La2-xSrxCuO4 single crystals in which the superconductivity had been stripped away by using high magnetic fields. In contrast to other quantum critical systems, the resistivity varies linearly with temperature over a wide doping range with a gradient that scales monotonically with the superconducting transition temperature. It is maximal at a critical doping level (pc) approximately 0.19 at which superconductivity is most robust. Moreover, its value at pc corresponds to the onset of quasi-particle incoherence along specific momentum directions, implying that the interaction that first promotes high-temperature superconductivity may ultimately destroy the very quasi-particle states involved in the superconducting pairing.},

@article{Takahashi2008,
abstract = {The iron- and nickel-based layered compounds LaOFeP (refs 1, 2) and LaONiP (ref. 3) have recently been reported to exhibit low-temperature superconducting phases with transition temperatures T(c) of 3 and 5 K, respectively. Furthermore, a large increase in the midpoint T(c) of up to approximately 26 K has been realized in the isocrystalline compound LaOFeAs on doping of fluoride ions at the O2- sites (LaO(1-x)F(x)FeAs). Experimental observations and theoretical studies suggest that these transitions are related to a magnetic instability, as is the case for most superconductors based on transition metals. In the copper-based high-temperature superconductors, as well as in LaOFeAs, an increase in T(c) is often observed as a result of carrier doping in the two-dimensional electronic structure through ion substitution in the surrounding insulating layers, suggesting that the application of external pressure should further increase T(c) by enhancing charge transfer between the insulating and conducting layers. The effects of pressure on these iron oxypnictide superconductors may be more prominent than those in the copper-based systems, because the As ion has a greater electronic polarizability, owing to the covalency of the Fe-As chemical bond, and, thus, is more compressible than the divalent O2- ion. Here we report that increasing the pressure causes a steep increase in the onset T(c) of F-doped LaOFeAs, to a maximum of approximately 43 K at approximately 4 GPa. With the exception of the copper-based high-T(c) superconductors, this is the highest T(c) reported to date. The present result, together with the great freedom available in selecting the constituents of isocrystalline materials with the general formula LnOTMPn (Ln, Y or rare-earth metal; TM, transition metal; Pn, group-V, 'pnicogen', element), indicates that the layered iron oxypnictides are promising as a new material platform for further exploration of high-temperature superconductivity.},

@article{Kimber2009,
abstract = {The discovery of a new family of high-T(C) materials, the iron arsenides (FeAs), has led to a resurgence of interest in superconductivity. Several important traits of these materials are now apparent: for example, layers of iron tetrahedrally coordinated by arsenic are crucial structural ingredients. It is also now well established that the parent non-superconducting phases are itinerant magnets, and that superconductivity can be induced by either chemical substitution or application of pressure, in sharp contrast to the cuprate family of materials. The structure and properties of chemically substituted samples are known to be intimately linked; however, remarkably little is known about this relationship when high pressure is used to induce superconductivity in undoped compounds. Here we show that the key structural features in BaFe2As2, namely suppression of the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition and reduction in the As-Fe-As bond angle and Fe-Fe distance, show the same behaviour under pressure as found in chemically substituted samples. Using experimentally derived structural data, we show that the electronic structure evolves similarly in both cases. These results suggest that modification of the Fermi surface by structural distortions is more important than charge doping for inducing superconductivity in BaFe2As2.},

@article{Doiron-Leyraud2007,
abstract = {Despite twenty years of research, the phase diagram of high-transition-temperature superconductors remains enigmatic. A central issue is the origin of the differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to opposite sides of the superconducting region. In the overdoped regime, the material behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi surface. The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to have no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected 'Fermi arcs'. The fundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi surface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the overdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the electrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5, establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state of underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped regime. Two possible interpretations are discussed: either a small pocket is part of the band structure specific to YBa2Cu3O6.5 or small pockets arise from a topological change at a critical point in the phase diagram. Our understanding of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors will depend critically on which of these two interpretations proves to be correct.},

Using high purity samples we are able to observe dHvA oscillations from all the sheets of Fermi surface and hence build up a complete detailed picture of its structure. The results show the existence of a highly warped section of hole surface which may be the origin of the nodal gap structure in this series. Importantly, we find that, even for this non-superconducting end member, one of the hole surfaces almost exactly nests with the inner electron surface. This suggests that improved geometric nesting does not drive the increase in pairing strength with decreasing x in this system.},

@article{Wilson2008,
abstract = {A detailed exposition is made of recent transport and 'quantum oscillation' results from HTSC systems covering the full range from overdoped to underdoped material. This now very extensive and high quality data set is interpreted here within the framework developed by the author of local pairs and boson-fermion resonance, arising in the context of negative-U behaviour in an inhomogeneous electronic environment. The strong inhomogeneity comes with the mixed-valent condition of these materials, which when underdoped lie in close proximity to the Mott-Anderson transition. The observed intense scattering is presented as resulting from pair formation and electron-boson collisions in the resonant crossover circumstance. The high level of scattering brings the systems to incoherence in the pseudogapped state, p < pc (= 0.183). In a high magnetic field the striped partition of the inhomogeneous charge distribution is much strengthened and regularized. Magnetization and resistance oscillations, of period dictated by the favoured positioning of the square fluxon array within the real space environment of the diagonal 2D charge striping array, are demonstrated to be responsible for the recently reported behaviour hitherto widely attributed to the quantum oscillation response of a much more standard Fermi liquid condition. A detailed analysis embracing all the experimental data serves to indicate that in the given conditions of very high field, low temperature, 2D-striped, underdoped, d-wave superconducting, HTSC material the flux quantum becomes doubled to h/e.},

From detailed low-energy electron diffraction measurements and an analysis of the ARPES polarization-dependence, we show that these pockets are not intrinsic, but arise from multiple overlapping superstructure replicas of the main and shadow bands. We further demonstrate that the hole pockets reported recently from ARPES [Meng et al, Nature 462, 335 (2009)] have a similar structural origin, and are inconsistent with an intrinsic hole pocket associated with the electronic structure of a doped CuO\$\_2\$ plane. The nature of the Fermi surface topology in the enigmatic pseudogap phase therefore remains an open question.},

abstract = {Magnetic interactions are generally believed to play a key role in mediating electron pairing for superconductivity in iron arsenides; yet their character is only partially understood. Experimentally, the antiferromagnetic (AF) transition is always preceded by or coincident with a tetragonal to orthorhombic structural distortion. Although it has been suggested that this lattice distortion is driven by an electronic nematic phase, where a spontaneously generated electronic liquid crystal state breaks the C4 rotational symmetry of the paramagnetic state, experimental evidence for electronic anisotropy has been either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase or the tetragonal phase under uniaxial pressure that breaks this symmetry. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to demonstrate the presence of a large in-plane spin anisotropy above TN in the unstressed tetragonal phase of BaFe2As2. In the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, we find highly anisotropic spin waves with a large damping along the AF a-axis direction. On warming the system to the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, the low-energy spin waves evolve into quasi-elastic excitations, while the anisotropic spin excitations near the zone boundary persist. These results strongly suggest that the spin nematicity we find in the tetragonal phase of BaFe2As2 is the source of the electronic and orbital anisotropy observed above TN by other probes, and has profound consequences for the physics of these materials.},

abstract = {High-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides occurs when the materials are chemically tuned to have a carrier concentration intermediate between their metallic state at high doping and their insulating state at zero doping. The underlying evolution of the electron system in the absence of superconductivity is still unclear, and a question of central importance is whether it involves any intermediate phase with broken symmetry. The Fermi surface of the electronic states in the underdoped 'YBCO' materials YBa2Cu3O(y) and YBa2Cu4O8 was recently shown to include small pockets, in contrast with the large cylinder that characterizes the overdoped regime, pointing to a topological change in the Fermi surface. Here we report the observation of a negative Hall resistance in the magnetic-field-induced normal state of YBa2Cu3O(y) and YBa2Cu4O8, which reveals that these pockets are electron-like rather than hole-like. We propose that these electron pockets most probably arise from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by the onset of a density-wave phase, as is thought to occur in the electron-doped copper oxides near the onset of antiferromagnetic order. Comparison with materials of the La2CuO4 family that exhibit spin/charge density-wave order suggests that a Fermi surface reconstruction also occurs in those materials, pointing to a generic property of high-transition-temperature (T(c)) superconductors.},

abstract = {We present a brief review of the present day situation with studies of high-temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides and chalcogenides. Recent discovery of superconductivity with T\_c > 30 K in A\_xFe\_\{2-x/2\}Se\_2 (A=K,Cs,Tl,...) represents the major new step in the development of new concepts in the physics of Fe - based high-temperature superconductors. We compare LDA and ARPES data on the band structure and Fermi surfaces of novel superconductors and those of the previously studied FeAs superconductors, especially isostructural 122 - superconductors like BaFe\_2As\_2. It appears that electronic structure of new superconductors is rather different from that of FeAs 122 - systems. In particular, no nesting properties of electron and hole - like Fermi surfaces is observed, casting doubts on most popular theoretical schemes of Cooper pairing for these systems. The discovery of Fe vacancies ordering and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at pretty high temperatures (T\_N> 500 K), much exceeding superconducting T\_c makes these systems unique antiferromagnetic superconductors with highest T\_N observed up to now. We discuss the role of both vacancies and AFM ordering in transformations of band structure and Fermi surfaces, as well as their importance for superconductivity. In particular, we show that system remains metallic with unfolded Fermi surfaces quite similar to that in paramagnetic state. Superconducting transition temperature T\_c of new superconductors is discussed within the general picture of superconductivity in multiple band systems. It is demonstrated that both in FeAs - superconductors and in new FeSe - systems the value of T\_c correlates with the value of the total density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level.},

abstract = {To understand the origin of superconductivity, it is crucial to ascertain the nature and origin of the primary carriers available to participate in pairing. Recent quantum oscillation experiments on high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxide superconductors have revealed the existence of a Fermi surface akin to that in normal metals, comprising fermionic carriers that undergo orbital quantization. The unexpectedly small size of the observed carrier pocket, however, leaves open a variety of possibilities for the existence or form of any underlying magnetic order, and its relation to d-wave superconductivity. Here we report experiments on quantum oscillations in the magnetization (the de Haas-van Alphen effect) in superconducting YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6.51) that reveal more than one carrier pocket. In particular, we find evidence for the existence of a much larger pocket of heavier mass carriers playing a thermodynamically dominant role in this hole-doped superconductor. Importantly, characteristics of the multiple pockets within this more complete Fermi surface impose constraints on the wavevector of any underlying order and the location of the carriers in momentum space. These constraints enable us to construct a possible density-wave model with spiral or related modulated magnetic order, consistent with experimental observations.},

abstract = {We have studied the three-dimensional shapes of the Fermi surfaces (FSs) of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 (x=0.38), where superconductivity is induced by isovalent P substitution, by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Moderately strong electron mass enhancement has been identified for both the electron and hole FSs. Among two observed hole FSs, the nearly two-dimensional one shows good nesting with the outer two-dimensional electron FS, but its orbital character is different from the outer electron FS. The three-dimensional hole FS shows poor nesting with the electron FSs. The present results suggest that the three-dimensionality and the difference in the orbital character weaken FS nesting, leaving partial nesting among the outer electron FSs of dxy character and/or that within the three-dimensional hole FS, which may lead to the nodal superconductivity.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {It is well established that the hole density in the prototypical superconductor La\$\_\{2-x\}\$Sr\$\_x\$CuO\$\_4\$ is very inhomogeneous due to Sr-dopant induced disorder. On the other hand, until recently it is widely believed that the hole distribution in HgBa\$\_2\$CuO\$\_\{4+\backslash delta\}\$ and Bi\$\_2\$Sr\$\_2\$CaCu\$\_2\$O\$\_\{8+\backslash delta\}\$ doped by interstitial oxygen is much more uniform. Recent nuclear magnetic resonance measurements indicate, however, that the charge inhomogeneity in HgBa\$\_2\$CuO\$\_\{4+\backslash delta\}\$ is close to that in La\$\_\{2-x\}\$Sr\$\_x\$CuO\$\_4\$. Calculations performed in the present paper confirm this observation. We also show that the charge inhomogeneity is most pronounced at the surface layer that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscope. Our simulations demonstrate that, despite having similar amplitudes of charge inhomogeneity, the hole mean free path in HgBa\$\_2\$CuO\$\_\{4+\backslash delta\}\$ is substantially longer than that in La\$\_\{2-x\}\$Sr\$\_x\$CuO\$\_4\$. The screening of Coulomb repulsion in HgBa\$\_2\$CuO\$\_\{4+\backslash delta\}\$ is also stronger. These two reasons might explain the difference in superconducting critical temperatures between these two compounds.},

abstract = {For already a decade the field of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) is one of the hottest. In spite of the great success of material specific Density Functional Theory (DFT) to provide accurately critical Curie temperatures (\$T\_\{C\}\$) in various III-V based materials, the ultimate search for a unifying model/theory was still an open issue. Many crucial questions were still without answer, as for example: Why, after one decade, does GaMnAs still exhibit the highest \$T\_\{C\}\$? Is there any intrinsic limitations or any hope to reach room temperature? How to explain in a unique theory the proximity of GaMnAs to the metal-insulator transition, and the change from RKKY couplings in II-VI materials to the double exchange regime in GaMnN? The aim of the present work is to provide this missing theory. We will show that the key parameter is the position of the Mn level acceptor and that GaMnAs has the highest \$T\_\{C\}\$ among III-V DMS. Our theory (i) provides an overall understanding, (ii) is quantitatively consistent with existing DFT based studies, (iii) able to explain both transport and magnetic properties in a broad variety of DMS and (iv) reproduces the \$T\_\{C\}\$ obtained from first principle studies for many materials including both GaMnN and GaMnAs. The model also reproduces accurately recent experimental data of the optical conductivity of GaMnAs and predicts those of other materials.},

abstract = {From analysis of the in-plane resistivity \$\backslash rho\_\{ab\}(T)\$ of La\$\_\{2-x\}\$Sr\$\_x\$CuO\$\_4\$, we show that normal state transport in overdoped cuprates can be delineated into two regimes in which the electrical resistivity varies approximately linearly with temperature. In the low temperature limit, the \$T\$-linear resistivity extends over a very wide doping range, in marked contrast to expectations from conventional quantum critical scenarios. The coefficient of this \$T\$-linear resistivity scales with the superconducting transition temperature \$T\_c\$, implying that the interaction causing this anomalous scattering is also associated with the superconducting pairing mechanism. At high temperatures, the coefficient of the \$T\$-linear resistivity is essentially doping independent beyond a critical doping \$p\_\{\backslash rm crit\}\$ = 0.19 at which the ratio of the two coefficients is maximal. Taking our cue from earlier thermodynamic and photoemission measurements, we conclude that the opening of the normal state pseudogap at \$p\_\{\backslash rm crit\}\$ is driven by the loss of coherence of anti-nodal quasiparticles at low temperatures.},

abstract = {We report the observation of a change in Fermi surface topology of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 with doping. By collecting high statistics ARPES data from moderately and highly overdoped samples and dividing the data by the Fermi function, we answer a long standing question about the Fermi surface shape of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 close to the (pi,0) point. For moderately overdoped samples (Tc=80K) we find that both the bonding and antibonding sheets of the Fermi surface are hole-like. However for a doping level corresponding to Tc=55K we find that the antibonding sheet becomes electron-like. This change does not directly affect the critical temperature and therefore the superconductivity. However, since similar observations of the change of the topology of the Fermi surface were observed in LSCO and Bi2Sr2Cu2O6, it appears to be a generic feature of hole-doped superconductors. Because of bilayer splitting, though, this doping value is considerably lower than that for the single layer materials, which again argues that it is unrelated to Tc.},

@article{Bardeen1957,
abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ??. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (??)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

abstract = {Weak-coupling approaches to the pairing problem in the iron pnictide superconductors have predicted a wide variety of superconducting ground states. We argue here that this is due both to the inadequacy of certain approximations to the effective low-energy band structure, and to the natural near-degeneracy of different pairing channels in superconductors with many distinct Fermi surface sheets. In particular, we review attempts to construct two-orbital effective band models, the argument for their fundamental inconsistency with the symmetry of these materials, and the comparison of the dynamical susceptibilities in two- and five-orbital models. We then present results for the magnetic properties, pairing interactions, and pairing instabilities within a five-orbital Random Phase Approximation model. We discuss the robustness of these results for different dopings, interaction strengths, and variations in band structure. Within the parameter space explored, an anisotropic, sign-changing s-wave state and a d\_x2-y2 state are nearly degenerate, due to the near nesting of Fermi surface sheets.},

@article{Custers2003,
abstract = {The point at absolute zero where matter becomes unstable to new forms of order is called a quantum critical point (QCP). The quantum fluctuations between order and disorder that develop at this point induce profound transformations in the finite temperature electronic properties of the material. Magnetic fields are ideal for tuning a material as close as possible to a QCP, where the most intense effects of criticality can be studied. A previous study on the heavy-electron material YbRh2Si2 found that near a field-induced QCP electrons move ever more slowly and scatter off one another with ever increasing probability, as indicated by a divergence to infinity of the electron effective mass and scattering cross-section. But these studies could not shed light on whether these properties were an artefact of the applied field, or a more general feature of field-free QCPs. Here we report that, when germanium-doped YbRh2Si2 is tuned away from a chemically induced QCP by magnetic fields, there is a universal behaviour in the temperature dependence of the specific heat and resistivity: the characteristic kinetic energy of electrons is directly proportional to the strength of the applied field. We infer that all ballistic motion of electrons vanishes at a QCP, forming a new class of conductor in which individual electrons decay into collective current-carrying motions of the electron fluid.},

abstract = {FeSe is employed as reference material to elucidate the observed high T c superconducting behaviour of the related layered iron pnictides. The structural and ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the Fe–X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a combination of resonant valence bond and excitonic insulator physics, and incorporating boson–fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different fashion, the latter leads to some similarities with the high temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The excitonic insulator behaviour sees spin density wave, charge density wave/periodic structural distortion, and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The conflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently mirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour. The delicate balance between ground states is made particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural form which it can engender. It is pointed out that several other notable superconductors, layered in form, semimetallic with indirect overlap and possessing homopolar bonding, would look to fall into the same general category, $\beta$-ZrNCl and MgB 2 and the high pressure forms of several elements, like sulfur, phosphorus, lithium and calcium, being cases in point.},

We calculate the real part of the non-interacting susceptibility, Re chi\_0(q), which is the relevant quantity for a charge density wave (CDW) instability and the imaginary part, Im chi\_0(q), which directly shows Fermi surface (FS) nesting. We show that there are very weak peaks in Re chi\_0(q) near the CDW wave vector, but that no such peaks are visible in Im chi\_0(q), definitively eliminating FS nesting as a factor in CDW formation. Because the peak in Re chi\_0(q) is broad and shallow, it is unlikely to be the direct cause of the CDW instability. We briefly address the possibility that electron-electron interactions (local field effects) produce additional structure in the total (renormalized) susceptibility, and we discuss the role of electron-ion matrix elements.},

@article{Kuroki2009,
annote = {Although a number of questions remain open, many experiments and calculations suggest that superconductivity in iron pnictides is induced by spin fluctuations that are associated with the nesting of disconnected Fermi surfaces or hole pockets. This mechanism can give rise to a superconducting gap that has s-wave symmetry but reverses sign on different pockets. However, a gap with d-wave symmetry (which implies nodes in the gap) has not been ruled out.
While many experiments on the superconductor LaFeAsO appear to be consistent with the sign-reversing s-wave scenario, experiments on LaFePO seem to suggest the presence of nodes as expected for a d-wave gap. Another interesting feature is that the superconducting critical temperature Tc varies widely in the iron pnictide family (from 5 to 55 K).
These observations pose a natural question: what governs the differences between individual pnictide compounds? In an article published in Physical Review B, Kazuhiko Kuroki of the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan, and collaborators from several Japanese several institutions address this question by constructing five-band models for several pnictide compounds and find that, assuming the superconductivity is mediated by spin-fluctuations, the gap has a strong dependence on the lattice structure. Depending upon the height of the pnictogen atom (As or P) from the FeAs (or FeP) plane, the system can have either a high Tc and a full gap with sign-reversing s-wave symmetry (as in LaFeAsO and NdFeAsO) or a low Tc with nodes in the gap (as in LaFePO). In addition to the height of the pnictogen atom, larger lattice constants increase Tc, although beyond a certain limit the tendency of these parameters to enhance magnetism is likely to dominate over their effect on superconductivity. – Sarma Kancharla

abstract = {Precise knowledge of electronic structures near the Fermi level is a prerequisite for understanding the origins of novel superconductivity. In the case of the iron-pnictide superconductors, ordinary electronic band structure calculations of the parent compounds fail; they greatly overestimate the antiferromagnetic ordered moment. Several moment-reduction methods have been proposed, e.g., pnictogen-height adjustment, use of negative-\$U\$. However, there is no experimentally determined benchmark for judging how successfully they reproduce band structures. Previous quantum oscillation and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on the orthorhombic phase used twinned crystals (except recently), hence in-plane anisotropy could only be resolved in special cases. It was recently demonstrated that BaFe\$\_2\$As\$\_2\$ can be detwinned mechanically. We report measurements of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations on detwinned BaFe\$\_2\$As\$\_2\$ single crystals. In-plane anisotropy is clearly observed, and the Fermi surface (FS) is completely determined. The determined FS suggests that critical reexaminations of previous ARPES data and theoretical approaches are needed.},

abstract = {We report resistivity and Hall effect results on Ba(Fe1-xNix)2As2 and compare them with those in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2. The Hall number RH is negative for all x values from 0.01 to 0.14, which indicates that electron carriers dominate the transport both in the magnetic and paramagnetic regime. We analyse the data in the framework of a two-band model. Without any assumption on the number of carriers, we show that the electron resistivity can be estimated with good accuracy in the low temperature paramagnetic range. Although the phase diagrams of the two families are very similar with respect to the extra electrons added in the system, we find that the transport properties differ in several aspects. First, we evidence that the contribution of holes to the transport is more important for Ni doping than for Co doping. Secondly, Ni behaves as a stronger scatterer for the electrons, as the increase of the residual electron resistivity rho/x is \~{}four times larger for Ni than for Co in the most doped samples.},

abstract = {Seven distinct families of superconductors with critical temperatures at ambient pressure that equal or surpass the historic 23 K limit for Nb3Ge have been discovered in the last 25 years. Each family is reviewed briefly and their common chemical features are discussed. High temperature superconductors are distinguished by having a high ($\backslash$geq 50\%) content of nonmetallic elements and fall into two broad classes. 'Metal-nonmetal' superconductors require a specific combination of elements such as Cu-O and Fe-As which give rise to the highest known Tc's, probably through a magnetic pairing mechanism. 'Nonmetal-bonded' materials contain covalently-bonded nonmetal anion networks and are BCS-like superconductors. Fitting an extreme value function to the distribution of Tc values for the known high-Tc families suggests that the probability of a newly discovered superconductor family having maximum Tc > 100 K is \~{}0.1-1\%, decreasing to \~{}0.02-0.2\% for room temperature superconductivity.},

While the latter are consistent with previous determinations of T*, we find that T'c is slightly larger than similar data taken by Nernst measurements. A careful investigation near optimal doping shows that T* becomes smaller than T'c, which is an unambiguous evidence that the pseudogap cannot be assigned to preformed pairs. Studies of the incidence of disorder on both T'c and T* allow us to propose a phase diagram including disorder which explains most observations done in other cuprate families, and to discuss the available knowledge on the pseudogap line in the phase diagram.},

It is markedly reduced by high current densities.

abstract = {The superconductivity in high temperature superconductors ordinarily arises when doped with hetero-valent ions that introduce charge carriers. However, in ferropnictides, "iso-valent" doping, which is generally believed not to introduce charge carriers, can induce superconductivity as well. Moreover, unlike other ferropnictides, the superconducting gap in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 has been found to contain nodal lines. The exact nature of the "iso-valent" doping and nodal gap here are key open issues in building a comprehensive picture of the iron-based high temperature superconductors. With angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we found that the phosphor substitution in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 induces sizable amount of holes into the hole Fermi surfaces, while the dxy-originated band is relatively intact. This overturns the previous common belief of "iso-valent" doping, explains why the phase diagram of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 is similar to those of the holedoped compounds, and rules out theories that explain the nodal gap based on vanishing dxy hole pocket.},

abstract = {Despite twenty years of research, the phase diagram of high-transition-temperature superconductors remains enigmatic. A central issue is the origin of the differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to opposite sides of the superconducting region. In the overdoped regime, the material behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi surface. The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to have no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected 'Fermi arcs'. The fundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi surface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the overdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the electrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5, establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state of underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped regime. Two possible interpretations are discussed: either a small pocket is part of the band structure specific to YBa2Cu3O6.5 or small pockets arise from a topological change at a critical point in the phase diagram. Our understanding of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors will depend critically on which of these two interpretations proves to be correct.},

abstract = {To understand the origin of superconductivity, it is crucial to ascertain the nature and origin of the primary carriers available to participate in pairing. Recent quantum oscillation experiments on high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxide superconductors have revealed the existence of a Fermi surface akin to that in normal metals, comprising fermionic carriers that undergo orbital quantization. The unexpectedly small size of the observed carrier pocket, however, leaves open a variety of possibilities for the existence or form of any underlying magnetic order, and its relation to d-wave superconductivity. Here we report experiments on quantum oscillations in the magnetization (the de Haas-van Alphen effect) in superconducting YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6.51) that reveal more than one carrier pocket. In particular, we find evidence for the existence of a much larger pocket of heavier mass carriers playing a thermodynamically dominant role in this hole-doped superconductor. Importantly, characteristics of the multiple pockets within this more complete Fermi surface impose constraints on the wavevector of any underlying order and the location of the carriers in momentum space. These constraints enable us to construct a possible density-wave model with spiral or related modulated magnetic order, consistent with experimental observations.},

abstract = {In a classical Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductor, pairing and coherence of electrons are established simultaneously below the critical transition temperature (T(c)), giving rise to a gap in the electronic energy spectrum. In the high-T(c) copper oxide superconductors, however, a pseudogap extends above T(c). The relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity is one of the central issues in this field. Spectral gaps arising from pairing precursors are qualitatively similar to those caused by competing electronic states, rendering a standard approach to their analysis inconclusive. The issue can be settled, however, by studying the correlation between the weights associated with the pseudogap and superconductivity spectral features. Here we report a study of two spectral weights using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The weight of the superconducting coherent peak increases away from the node following the trend of the superconducting gap, but starts to decrease in the antinodal region. This striking non-monotonicity reveals the presence of a competing state. We demonstrate a direct correlation, for different values of momenta and doping, between the loss in the low-energy spectral weight arising from the opening of the pseudogap and a decrease in the spectral weight associated with superconductivity. We therefore conclude that the pseudogap competes with the superconductivity by depleting the spectral weight available for pairing.},

abstract = {In the iron arsenide compound BaFe2As2, superconductivity can be induced either by a variation of its chemical composition, e.g., by replacing Fe with Co, or by a reduction of the unit-cell volume through the application of hydrostatic pressure p. In contrast to chemical substitutions, pressure is expected to introduce no additional disorder into the lattice. We compare the two routes to superconductivity by measuring the p dependence of the superconducting transition temperature Tc of Ba(Fe(1-x)Cox)2As2 single crystals with different Co content x. We find that Tc(p) of underdoped and overdoped samples increases and decreases, respectively, tracking quantitatively the Tc(x) dependence. To clarify to which extent the superconductivity relies on distinct structural features we analyze the crystal structure as a function of x and compare the results with that of BaFe2As2 under pressure.},

@phdthesis{Mercure2010a,
abstract = {Highly correlated electron materials are systems in which many new states of matter can emerge. A particular situation which favours the formation of exotic phases of the electron liquid in complex materials is that where a quantum critical point (QCP) is present the phase diagram. Neighbouring regions in parameter space reveal unusual physical properties, described as non-Fermi liquid behaviour. One of the important problems in quantum criticality is to find out how the Fermi surface (FS) of a material evolves near a QCP. The traditional method for studying the FS of materials is the de Haas van Alphen effect (dHvA). A quantum critical end point (QCEP) has been reported in the highly correlated metal Sr3Ru2O7, which is tuned using a magnetic field high enough to perform the dHvA experiment. It moreover features a new emergent phase in the vicinity of the QCEP, a nematic type of electron ordering. The subject of this thesis is the study of the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 using the dHvA effect. Three aspects were explored. The first was the determination of the FS at fields both above and below that where the QCEP arises. The second was the search for quantum oscillations inside the nematic phase. The third was a reinvestigation of the behaviour of the quasiparticle effective masses near the FS. A complete robust model for the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 at zero fields was determined. Moreover, the new measurements of the quasiparticle masses revealed that no mass enhancements exist anywhere around the QCEP. Finally, we report dHvA oscillations inside the nematic phase, which suggests that the carriers consist of Landau quasiparticles.},

In addition to the feature at \$T\_\{SM\}\$, the inter-plane resistivity shows a maximum at \$T\^{}*\backslash sim\$200 K, which moves slightly to higher temperature with doping, revealing a trend opposite to the electron-doped materials. A smeared feature at about the same temperature is seen in \$\backslash rho\_a(T)\$. For \$T<T\^{}*\$, the temperature dependence of resistivity shows systematic evolution and is close to linear at optimal doping. This feature, being most pronounced for \$\backslash rho\_c(T)\$, suggests the existence of a quantum critical point close to optimal doping.},

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of the electronic structure of BaFe2As2 in its paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, through angle-resolved photoemission studies. Using different experimental geometries, we resolve the full elliptic shape of the electron pockets, including parts of dxy symmetry along its major axis that are usually missing. This allows us to define precisely how the hole and electron pockets are nested and how the different orbitals evolve at the transition. We conclude that the imperfect nesting between hole and electron pockets explains rather well the formation of gaps and residual metallic droplets in the AFM phase, provided the relative parity of the different bands is taken into account. Beyond this nesting picture, we observe shifts and splittings of numerous bands at the transition. We show that the splittings are surface sensitive and probably not a reliable signature of the magnetic order. On the other hand, the shifts indicate a significant redistribution of the orbital occupations at the transition, especially within the dxz/dyz system, which we discuss.},

We are able to identify two main differences in their electronic properties. First, the shadow band that is present in double layer and low T\$\_\{c,max\}\$ single layer cuprates is absent in Tl2201. Recent studies have linked the shadow band to structural distortions in the lattice and the absence of these in Tl2201 may be a contributing factor in its T\$\_\{c,max\}\$.Second, Tl2201's Fermi surface (FS) contains long straight parallel regions near the anti-node, while in Bi2201 the anti-nodal region is much more rounded. Since the size of the superconducting gap is largest in the anti-nodal region, differences in the band dispersion at the anti-node may play a significant role in the pairing and therefore affect the maximum transition temperature.},

abstract = {High-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides occurs when the materials are chemically tuned to have a carrier concentration intermediate between their metallic state at high doping and their insulating state at zero doping. The underlying evolution of the electron system in the absence of superconductivity is still unclear, and a question of central importance is whether it involves any intermediate phase with broken symmetry. The Fermi surface of the electronic states in the underdoped 'YBCO' materials YBa2Cu3O(y) and YBa2Cu4O8 was recently shown to include small pockets, in contrast with the large cylinder that characterizes the overdoped regime, pointing to a topological change in the Fermi surface. Here we report the observation of a negative Hall resistance in the magnetic-field-induced normal state of YBa2Cu3O(y) and YBa2Cu4O8, which reveals that these pockets are electron-like rather than hole-like. We propose that these electron pockets most probably arise from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by the onset of a density-wave phase, as is thought to occur in the electron-doped copper oxides near the onset of antiferromagnetic order. Comparison with materials of the La2CuO4 family that exhibit spin/charge density-wave order suggests that a Fermi surface reconstruction also occurs in those materials, pointing to a generic property of high-transition-temperature (T(c)) superconductors.},

abstract = {To understand the origin of superconductivity, it is crucial to ascertain the nature and origin of the primary carriers available to participate in pairing. Recent quantum oscillation experiments on high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxide superconductors have revealed the existence of a Fermi surface akin to that in normal metals, comprising fermionic carriers that undergo orbital quantization. The unexpectedly small size of the observed carrier pocket, however, leaves open a variety of possibilities for the existence or form of any underlying magnetic order, and its relation to d-wave superconductivity. Here we report experiments on quantum oscillations in the magnetization (the de Haas-van Alphen effect) in superconducting YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6.51) that reveal more than one carrier pocket. In particular, we find evidence for the existence of a much larger pocket of heavier mass carriers playing a thermodynamically dominant role in this hole-doped superconductor. Importantly, characteristics of the multiple pockets within this more complete Fermi surface impose constraints on the wavevector of any underlying order and the location of the carriers in momentum space. These constraints enable us to construct a possible density-wave model with spiral or related modulated magnetic order, consistent with experimental observations.},

abstract = {Despite twenty years of research, the phase diagram of high-transition-temperature superconductors remains enigmatic. A central issue is the origin of the differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to opposite sides of the superconducting region. In the overdoped regime, the material behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi surface. The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to have no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected 'Fermi arcs'. The fundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi surface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the overdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the electrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5, establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state of underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped regime. Two possible interpretations are discussed: either a small pocket is part of the band structure specific to YBa2Cu3O6.5 or small pockets arise from a topological change at a critical point in the phase diagram. Our understanding of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors will depend critically on which of these two interpretations proves to be correct.},

@article{Takahashi2008,
abstract = {The iron- and nickel-based layered compounds LaOFeP (refs 1, 2) and LaONiP (ref. 3) have recently been reported to exhibit low-temperature superconducting phases with transition temperatures T(c) of 3 and 5 K, respectively. Furthermore, a large increase in the midpoint T(c) of up to approximately 26 K has been realized in the isocrystalline compound LaOFeAs on doping of fluoride ions at the O2- sites (LaO(1-x)F(x)FeAs). Experimental observations and theoretical studies suggest that these transitions are related to a magnetic instability, as is the case for most superconductors based on transition metals. In the copper-based high-temperature superconductors, as well as in LaOFeAs, an increase in T(c) is often observed as a result of carrier doping in the two-dimensional electronic structure through ion substitution in the surrounding insulating layers, suggesting that the application of external pressure should further increase T(c) by enhancing charge transfer between the insulating and conducting layers. The effects of pressure on these iron oxypnictide superconductors may be more prominent than those in the copper-based systems, because the As ion has a greater electronic polarizability, owing to the covalency of the Fe-As chemical bond, and, thus, is more compressible than the divalent O2- ion. Here we report that increasing the pressure causes a steep increase in the onset T(c) of F-doped LaOFeAs, to a maximum of approximately 43 K at approximately 4 GPa. With the exception of the copper-based high-T(c) superconductors, this is the highest T(c) reported to date. The present result, together with the great freedom available in selecting the constituents of isocrystalline materials with the general formula LnOTMPn (Ln, Y or rare-earth metal; TM, transition metal; Pn, group-V, 'pnicogen', element), indicates that the layered iron oxypnictides are promising as a new material platform for further exploration of high-temperature superconductivity.},

We show that, despite the shrinking of the Fermi surfaces with respect to first-principle calculations, the charge-carrier concentration in each band is almost unchanged, with a substantial conservation of the total optical sum rule. However, a significant transfer of spectral weight occurs from low-energy coherent processes to incoherent ones, with practical consequences on the experimental estimate of the sum rule, that is carried out integrating the data up to a finite cut-off. This has profound consequences both on the absolute value of the sum rule and on its temperature dependence, that must be taken into account while discussing optical experiments in these systems.},

We argue here that this is due both to the inadequacy of certain approximations to the effective low-energy band structure, and to the natural near-degeneracy of different pairing channels in superconductors with many distinct Fermi surface sheets. In particular, we review attempts to construct two-orbital effective band models, the argument for their fundamental inconsistency with the symmetry of these materials, and the comparison of the dynamical susceptibilities in two- and five-orbital models. We then present results for the magnetic properties, pairing interactions, and pairing instabilities within a five-orbital Random Phase Approximation model. We discuss the robustness of these results for different dopings, interaction strengths, and variations in band structure. Within the parameter space explored, an anisotropic, sign-changing s-wave state and a d\_x2-y2 state are nearly degenerate, due to the near nesting of Fermi surface sheets.},

The Hall number RH is negative for all x values from 0.01 to 0.14, which indicates that electron carriers dominate the transport both in the magnetic and paramagnetic regime. We analyse the data in the framework of a two-band model. Without any assumption on the number of carriers, we show that the electron resistivity can be estimated with good accuracy in the low temperature paramagnetic range. Although the phase diagrams of the two families are very similar with respect to the extra electrons added in the system, we find that the transport properties differ in several aspects. First, we evidence that the contribution of holes to the transport is more important for Ni doping than for Co doping. Secondly, Ni behaves as a stronger scatterer for the electrons, as the increase of the residual electron resistivity rho/x is \~{}four times larger for Ni than for Co in the most doped samples.},

abstract = {We investigated the superconducting gap structure of SrNi\$\_2\$P\$\_\{2\}\$ (\$T\_c\$=1.4 K) via low-temperature magneto-thermal conductivity \$\backslash kappa(T,H)\$ measurements. Zero field thermal conductivity \$\backslash kappa\$ decreases exponentially \$\backslash kappa \backslash propto\$ exp(\$-aT\_c/T\$) with \$a\$=1.5, in accord with the BCS theory, and rolls over to a phonon-like \$\backslash kappa\backslash propto T\^{}3\$ behavior at low temperature, similar to a number of conventional s-wave superconductors. In addition, we observed a "concave" field dependence of the residual linear term \$\backslash kappa\_0(H)/T\$. These facts strongly rule out the presence of nodes in the superconducting energy gap of SrNi\$\_2\$P\$\_\{2\}\$. Together with a fully gapped Fermi surface in the superconducting state of BaNi\$\_2\$As\$\_\{2\}\$ (\$T\_c\$=0.6-0.7 K), demonstrated in our recent work, these results lead us to postulate that fully gapped superconductivity is a universal feature of Ni-based pnictide superconductors.},

abstract = {We use highly accurate density functional calculations to study the band structure and Fermi surfaces of NbSe2. We calculate the real part of the non-interacting susceptibility, Re chi\_0(q), which is the relevant quantity for a charge density wave (CDW) instability and the imaginary part, Im chi\_0(q), which directly shows Fermi surface (FS) nesting. We show that there are very weak peaks in Re chi\_0(q) near the CDW wave vector, but that no such peaks are visible in Im chi\_0(q), definitively eliminating FS nesting as a factor in CDW formation. Because the peak in Re chi\_0(q) is broad and shallow, it is unlikely to be the direct cause of the CDW instability. We briefly address the possibility that electron-electron interactions (local field effects) produce additional structure in the total (renormalized) susceptibility, and we discuss the role of electron-ion matrix elements.},

Both the magnetic and structural transitions are gradually suppressed with increased Ru concentration and coexist with superconductivity. For samples that are superconducting, we find strong competition between superconductivity, the antiferromagnetic ordering, and the structural distortion.},

@article{Harriger2010,
abstract = {Magnetic interactions are generally believed to play a key role in mediating electron pairing for superconductivity in iron arsenides; yet their character is only partially understood. Experimentally, the antiferromagnetic (AF) transition is always preceded by or coincident with a tetragonal to orthorhombic structural distortion. Although it has been suggested that this lattice distortion is driven by an electronic nematic phase, where a spontaneously generated electronic liquid crystal state breaks the C4 rotational symmetry of the paramagnetic state, experimental evidence for electronic anisotropy has been either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase or the tetragonal phase under uniaxial pressure that breaks this symmetry. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to demonstrate the presence of a large in-plane spin anisotropy above TN in the unstressed tetragonal phase of BaFe2As2. In the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, we find highly anisotropic spin waves with a large damping along the AF a-axis direction. On warming the system to the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, the low-energy spin waves evolve into quasi-elastic excitations, while the anisotropic spin excitations near the zone boundary persist. These results strongly suggest that the spin nematicity we find in the tetragonal phase of BaFe2As2 is the source of the electronic and orbital anisotropy observed above TN by other probes, and has profound consequences for the physics of these materials.},
