
In chapter~\ref{Sec:ResD} \ac{dHvA} measurements were presented on a high quality samples of \BaFeP. Energy dispersions from \ac{DFT} calculations were tweaked to match the measured Fermi surface orbits by rigidly shifting both the electron energy bands and the inner hole band. The outer hole band energy dispersion was tweaked proportionally to the \DzTwo band character.
