% This thesis has evolved into a work of two halves. On one side is Tony Carrington and the work exploring the pairing mechanism in exciting new pnictide materials and on the other side is Nigel Hussey and the work picking apart the finer points of the cuprate phase diagram. Nonetheless all of this work falls under the broad umbrella of CES research and accurately reflects a rich experience working in the world leading group at Bristol.
