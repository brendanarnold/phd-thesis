Finally, it is done. This thesis marks the culmination of what has been a very enjoyable four years at Bristol working in one of the worlds leading low temperature groups. Perhaps quite naturally this thesis has evolved into a work of two halves. On one side is Prof. Tony Carrington and the work exploring the pairing mechanism in the recently discovered pnictide materials and on the other side is Prof. Nigel Hussey and the work picking apart the fine detail of the cuprate phase diagram. Nonetheless all of this work falls under the broad umbrella of CES research and accurately reflects a rich experience working in the group at Bristol. I would like to thank both of my supervisors for guiding me through the PhD with a great deal of patience and support and allowing me to spend time at summer schools in weird parts of Europe.

I would like to thank our collaborators Prof. Shibauchi and his group at Kyoto university who grew the \BaFePAs crystals and Prof. Takeuchi and his group at Sendai University for the \acs{BSCO} samples. The first set of high field data taken at the \ac{LNCMI}, Toulouse was taken with the help of Dr. Baptiste Vignolle, Prof. Cyril Proust and Dr. Patrick Rourke. The second set of high field data was taken by Dr. Baptiste Vignolle, Prof. Cyril Proust, Dr. Patrick Rourke, Prof. Nigel Hussey and Dr. Jean-Francois Mercure. The final set of high field data from \ac{HFML}, Nijmegen was taken by Dr. Patrick Rourke, Dr. Alix McCollam, Ioanna Mouzoupoulou and Dr. Xiaofeng Xu. I would also like to acknowledge Dr. Mairi Haddow for help on the x-ray characterisation.

I also owe thanks to the workshop staff, John Rowden, Adrian Crimp, Tim Newbury and especially Richard Exley who helped with experiments early on and also gave lots of help and advice regarding the first two years of the PhD spent aboard Greenwood.

I would like to thank members of the CES group throughout my time here who have made my life and work enjoyable. These include Dr. Ali Bangura, Dr. Rosie Cooper, Dr. Benoit Faque, Dr. M. French, Dr. Neil Headings, Dr. Liam Malone, Iioanna Mouzoupoulou, Carsten Putzke, Dr. Alessandro Serafin, Nick Wakeham and Phil Walmsley. I would like to thank Dr. Jon Fletcher for huge amounts of support early on and for being a pretty sound kind of person. Dr. Patrick Rourke and Dr. Jean-Francois Mercure for similar reasons. Special late night, long weekend and drinking credit goes to Dr. Xiaofeng Xu, Dr. Chris Lester and Dr. Caroline Andrew and I owe thanks to Bob Wiltshire and James Kelly for the craic.

Finally thanks to my family to whom I owe just about everything else.
